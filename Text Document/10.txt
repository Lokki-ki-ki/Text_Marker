Do you think it's a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age? In some societies, students are expected to identity a career by the time they enter high school. Yes it is a good idea to start young because your already step ahead, you will have background knowledge about the career classes you choose and once you get older you won't have time to choose a career. Also taking courses in high school will help you choose your career like for an example academy classes. As a student taking a career course, will help them learn more about that career, and you will have background knowledge about that career. For an example I'm taking auto technology in high-cal because I want to learn more about cars and how to fix them. After high school I will be going to a community college, so I can learn an advance auto technology class and move on and that's I'm going to succeed in life. Another reason why it's a good idea for students to commit to a career at young age is because it will help students choose a good career that pays good money and the students will be a one step ahead. By doing this they will accomplish their goals. Others may say that it's not a good idea for students to commit a career at a young age because they think its waste of time however, it's not waste of their time, because once you're getting older you won't have time to choose a career that will last. In conclusion, I think it's a good an idea for students to commit to a career at a young age because you will have some background knowledge to that specific career, you will be one step ahead, and once you get older you won't have time to choose a career.
