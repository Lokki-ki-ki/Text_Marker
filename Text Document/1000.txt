The school board plans to add one and a half hours to school each day. I disagree with this plan because everyone will be in a bad mood they will start to skip school and do bad acts, teens will be late to work and lose there jobs, and I feel like if we add more time to school there will be no tine for family. First, the school bored wants to add more time to school. Kids and teachers are already tried, adding more time will make it worst it will start making kids want to skip school or even start acting bad. I have a friend who will already skip school some days. He said, "school can get to bore ding who will want to sit in class longer inside of playing soccer with you friends." I think there will be more kids will skip school like my friend. Then, some kids or teens like the high school kids, will be later for their jobs. My sister work at Pizza Hut right after school. Adding more time to school will make her late to work, they will even fire her for being late. If the school board adds more time they will be taken jobs and money away from teens like my sis. Finely, family is every informed if the school bored adds more time to school there will no time for family. School already take up a lot of time. I love to be with my family and I'll pick it over school anytime. My family and I watch movies each Friday. My stepdad picks out the movies with my little brother, and I help out my mom making the popcorn. It's so much fun, but if school has to be longer then I will not be able to watch movies and others kids will not be able to family stuff too. All in all, I hope you agree with me and don't add more time to school.
