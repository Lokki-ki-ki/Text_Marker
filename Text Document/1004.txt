I agree with what American jazz legend Duke Ellington said, if there's a problem in the world and to know how to solve it is like your opportunity to show the world that you a person that could matter to everyone like if you know the sou lotion to a problem then you are more likely to be more successful at what you do. Another reason is to help others with what there dealing like love problems like losing a lifetime best friend or family member like you can help them with a solution and may help others with health problems homework problems stuff your good at and ways you can help them your not just helping them you're helping yourself with staying and helping people can make yourself feel proud like a person that matters in life, and you will be known of what you do. Think like this if you help others and people think good about you, then you're not going to be forgotten and not be alone in life and have a better future ahead of you its like your dream life and supporting others with helping them in difficult issues.
