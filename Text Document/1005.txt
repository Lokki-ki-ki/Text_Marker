I agree with Churchill's to be success consists of going from failure to failure without loss enthusiasm, it that's matter if you are failure, and you are not even losing your enthusiasm but at list you try, that is the most important thing.First, you will never know everything but the most important things are trying because if you don't try, you will never learn, but sometimes It's okay to be failure without an enthusiasm that means that you don't care, you are not interested in anything or another way to see that don't have an enthusiasm is when you waste time for example if I feel like I am just losing every time and i don't even has an enthusiasm, something to be focus, I will enjoy my time to try to better, to be a winner I always will be tried to increase. Secondly, some time people love to be a better person, but there will be people who doesn't enjoy the time to increase, I just know one thing for sure some time people like to stay in the same step because if you want to be a winner, you must try and see what you can do to go up, I will try to have a good future, a better future for my family, to have my own things, living failure make you a weak person everyone can see that you are weak, that you are not smart enough, that you are comfortable for what you have, but you must be an ambition person to have more than what you have. Thirdly, if you don't want to live failure you must win the opportunity, I just know that this world is for smartest people, here survive the person who can use there brain carefully, people who are not making bad mistake, but we are humansâ€™m humans make mistake, but that is okay you must fix it you must increase yourself to keep something in your heart that can motivate yourself. Concluion, on my opinion I can say it's okay if you want to stay in the same step, but you will never understand the meaning of life if you never try, you should try at least one time.
