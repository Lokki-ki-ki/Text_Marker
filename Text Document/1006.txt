Technology has come a long way of the past hundreds of years. Technology has made so many things possible for us humans, we took a man to the moon because of technology. But technology also, has its pros and cons. Us as humans, we're depending on technology way too much. People are buy clothes, and buying food without having to talk to another person. Technology has made it so easy for people to buy things online. You can be sitting on your couch, pull out your phone, and order bananas, hammers, and an eagles beak. The next day, a drone will fly to your house and deliver it right on your door step. We don't have to leave our houses anymore, or talk to anyone. We're able to do this because, of the use of technology. People don't even have to leave their house anymore to see someone. You can pull out your phone, and live video chat with anyone you want to see. Some people might think that's a good thing, that we'll never leave our houses again. But us as humans, we need that human interaction. Without having to leave our houses how can we travel the world, or even meet our soul mate. We're not going to be able to do that sort of things, if technology is just making everything so easy for us. There are ways that technology is helping us like transportation, and constructing buildings. But the limitation of human contact, is due to the use of technology. We need to stop depending on technology to do simple task for us. This needs to stop before it becomes normal for people to do these sorts of things.
