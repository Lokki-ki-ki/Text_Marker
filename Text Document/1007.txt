Thomas Jefferson I am agree with this wrote that you did, I think he wrote it because sometimes people are not doing good thing and right. First, when we are accomplished something we need to be proud of yourself, it is wonderful when other people are getting done their goals. Second, we may not believe on what other people said to you because sometimes you are right but if you pay attention you can go down with your goals, that why you have to finish your accomplish alone. Also, when we're done something we feel very happy and that can help us to follow what we actually need to be a great people. For example: if we are idle we never can be great on our future, we need to know and be sure that if we do not follow our dream, it can not come true, like when you are in the college, and you said I need to be a nurse or something like that you have to go to the college every single day and stay strong for all that you are making and when you're done, you will see your that dream come true and them you can see all the effort that you did. In conclusion: we need to know that everything can be possible and be sure what we are doing because is the only way to stay strong and not down of everything because we need to be proud of yourself and not be selfish with other people because of anyway everybody need to have the same right, we need to feel happy about what other people are doing, because on the end you can see your effort and your dream come true!
