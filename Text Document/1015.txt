A science experiment is enjoyable and educational because you are in a group sometimes, and you are had fun, and you are learning new stuff. Other school subjects should do that because people pay more attention to it nobody likes having a teacher sit there and give you a packet to learn nothing all day. Science experiments are the best because you see what's happening and you're getting it more. It makes it better to get a hand on activity then just looking at a book all the time. I feel like more people have As than FS in science because the experiment helps people a lot. Over all it's just a better than to do because helps peoples grade helps them understand what they are trying to teach them. I personally like science experiments more than any other classes because it helps me have an A in that class. Other people like it because people in my since class always get happy when the teacher says we do have an experiment to do. Overall I feel like experiments are more educational and fun activity
