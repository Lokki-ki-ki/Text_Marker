Dear, Principality a good thing that your requirement all students to perform community service, Because it's a good thing that we should have been community clean. I think we should have it clean because what if someone from another state comes to are state there going to see how dirty it is. They will start talking bad of are state and people would not come no more. Also, if that family was thinking to move were we live, there going to change there mind, because they saw how dirty it was and people want a place to live and were is clean. So Principle is a good thing that you're trying to change that. Not all students could do that also adults they could help too.sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
