Students are expected to identify a career? I think students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school, because student should think in their future wild there in high school because they can start to get ready to University or college to choose what career they would like to study. I think student can start thinking in what kind of career they want to study in high school at a young age because it is important to students to known what career they want to story after finishing high school.in some societies, students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school because they can select a specific guide to help study better for your career. FOR EXAMPLE: My friend is in high school right now, and she is thinking about collage, what does she want to become, and she tells me she wants to be a teacher to teach other kids math because she is very good at math, so she is getting really to college and studying to become a teacher.However,; others said that young boy don't have to worry about any career wild there in high school because they still younger, but otherwise I think is a good idea to start thinking in college when you are in high school because is important for kids to known what career they want.
