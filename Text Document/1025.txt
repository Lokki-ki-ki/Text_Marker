I believe that high school students, shouldn't and should commit to just one career. My first reason that they shouldn't is that the students can change want to do as a career. My first reason why that they should is that this we don't need to go college if we are studying the class in high school. My other reason we should is that is good to now about that career you want to do in the future. For an example like ROTC is an amazing thing it shows about how military life is going to be if you go throw that path. An other example is AOL it shows a care you want to learn about like becoming a firefighter and more like that. An other great expand is a career for a day. So those are great exp lames to help students stand that career more in death. My other reason why we shouldn't is that this high school we are speaking about we don't have to chose just one career and stick with it. But lastly it's your chose go to a school that does make you do that or not do that!
