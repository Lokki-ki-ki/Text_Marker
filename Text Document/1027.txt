Do curfews keep teenagers out of troubled they unfairly interfere in young people lives the curfew wants to Procter them people would think that they are interfered in their life. They want them to be safe people won't like other people do what they said. They want to stop adoption at 10pm something's people like the wrong way. I think that curfew are trying to Procter them, and they don't want to interfere in their lives. But if the curfew are adopting teenagers on the street after this hour they are breaking the law they are saying that they don't want other one to do adoptions after 10pm on weekday and on the midnight of the weekend. The curfew want to interfere in other people lives, because people won't like the curfew say something what they are respecting, and they are not doing the right thing. Curfew they think that they are doing the right thing, but they are not cause, if they would be doing the right thing they would already stop all that. It is unfairly that they are doing that because the don't have to care about other people. I think that they don't have to do that because something's, people would like it, but not all the times they would like it
