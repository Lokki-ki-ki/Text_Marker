Do not lazy, many people need dream. One reason, If we attitude to think about what is plan need to finished, we don't feel boring., we feel a lot of power. For example: the students will know next class should be taking the test, the students plan to study tonight, they do study guide, more practice during the test they will get good great. Another reason, students can to do volutes or study SAT, get high soccer, also need to do very well in the class taking AP class get high GPA. For example, students on the weekend can go to hospital or go to library to do volutes, learn society experience that is helpful get into college, and spend some time to study SAT to finish homework.
