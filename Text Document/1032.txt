You are in trouble. As your teachers might tell you, behave when you are in school. That includes in the halls, cafeteria, and even on the school bus. By following simple rule that are established for your safety, you won't lose your school staff's trust. Behave when you are in the halls. When the bell rings, and you are dismissed, go to your other class immediately. Don't take a walk around the school, go to the gym, or cause traffic by standing in the halls and talking to your friends. It's not a safe nether is it responsible. Keep your hands to your self, unless if it's an activity that allowed you to touch the other students or even staff members with adult supervision. Behave in the cafeteria. Once you are in line to get your food, you should respect others by waiting your turn. This isn't only respectful, but it's even a good habit. Walk back to your seat, don't run. Running could cause for you to spill your food, and someone could slip and that resulting in an injury. When you finish your food, cleanup after your self if necessary. Behave when you are on the school bus. When you are on the bus it's nice of you to greet your bus drive, but you don't have to. Quietly walk to an open seat and sit down. Sit with your grade level. Once settled, you could quietly talk to the person sitting next to you, don't yell across the bus. On the bus it is important for the bus driver to be able to see from the back window or door to prevent car accidents, don't put your stuff in the middle of walkway. If you are going to be eating on the bus, which you are not aloud, unless the bus driver said so, clean up any mess that you may have caused. Showing responsible and appropriate behaviors could make teachers more flexible with any other improper behavior that you may cause. For an example, you are a bad student, you were late to class, and you decided to run. The teacher catches you, and you get in trouble. Example two, you are a good student, you were late to class, the bell rings, but you don't run, the teacher forgives you." You are free to pick to choose your actions, but you aren't free from the consequences" said somebody.
