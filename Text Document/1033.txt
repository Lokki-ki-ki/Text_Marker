Can people accomplish more if they are doing something? Yes, the more people thrive to be active the more they will accomplish. Thomas Jefferson wrote, "It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing". Although some say being inactive serves a purpose, nevertheless, if people are doing something productive they will accomplish more because they will become active and gives self-confidence. To begin, many people are inactive which does not serve them a purpose. For example, everyone is doing something on their agenda weather it's working, school, or shopping. People are accomplishing daily tasks every day. This shows that, when people are doing something it serves them a purpose to be active which helps accomplish goals. Clearly, if people do not commit to becoming active they will not accomplish many goals. Furthermore, this gives people confidence and assurance that goals or tasks will be fulfilled. For instance, when being active while accomplishing goals people start to have confidence and assurance that being active can help with accomplishments. This proves that, people are best when active because they become confidant with themselves. Overall, while not being active and doing something productive people will not see the potential they have. In conclusion, when humans are doing something, they accomplish goals which help them develop confidence and can measure how much they are active.
