First, I would say I agree with most of the student that they are interesting to finish their high school in three years, and in my opinion that is good for them so, they can have more years for college and some students have to do that to graduate early for example, I am one of them I have to finish the high school in three years because when I came to United States I came too old and I didn't take the freshman year in United States that is why I have to graduate in three years. Most of the students are preparing for good colleges and some of the colleges you have to stay so many years to finish them. And also from my experience it is hard enough as it as in four years but I know so many students have done it before and they sussed on it. And I know some students have done it too but in 2.5 years. And I almost have done it, and it has been good for me, but it needs a lot of work, and you have to study hard and forces in your school and do your homework and get good grades and don't do any problems in school because if you did anything wrong you are going to stay more years at the school.it is good to graduate early when you are young, so you will have a lot of years in college to be a heifer education. At the end I would say and support every one that want to graduate early because it is good for their future and I have to say thank you for the people that they are helping me to do that.
