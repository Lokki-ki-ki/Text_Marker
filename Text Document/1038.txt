The character is the way how you act or behave, and I think that you can form your own character, and you can choose your own character traits, no one can influence in what your character or personality is. However, some people may think that your character can be influence by which you interact with (like parents), and your personality is based in others personality. You choose what you want it to be, no one can choose your own way, or in this case your character, is primordial that you choose your own traits, if you don't do that then you'll be unsecure of your self and that can carry many problems to distinguish who you are, or where you should go in life. Have your own character is a big thing to have, because many people can imitate others character or personality from their parents or any famous person, but if you have you own character that means that you are unique. A recent study in the University of Virginia shows that people who choose their own character and their own way to act, or behave, they are happier than the ones that imitated other people personality. You are your owner, you are only yours! Since you are a baby you start forming your character or personality, you have control of what you want to be or what you want it to do. But some people will argue that your parents are whom form your character, and they chose your personality traits, but that is not true, your character is formed by your own experiences in life, as John Lubbock wrote "Your character will be what your self loose to make it." In conclusion, you can be whoever you want, your character will be formed by you based in your experiences in life, no one can choose what your character or personality will be. People will always judge you, but You always must do what your heart tells you to do, be always happy with your own personality or character, and don't let people choose how you will act (not even your parents), make your own character and act in the right way.
