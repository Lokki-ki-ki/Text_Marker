When was the last time you looked up from your phone to admire the sky? The first thing everyone does when they wake is check their phone. We depend on technology every day, we live with it. Technology is changing, evolving even, but are we? I mean, we put our lives in technology though the internet comparing ourselves with one and the other. No wonder so many of us are depressed, they see what other people have but to blind to see what they have is important. Everyone sees the same thing but have a different perspective.Time-wasting is a big one. Peoples eyes are glued to their own personal screen. Steeple. They care about the new, the best, the bad, and the ugly. They only care about themselves and there phones and shirts with a red bar that says supreme in white text. Competing for the most likes and for the most clout, the fake life they make on the internet is all they care about. Talking the most negative to people through face to FaceTime never to the other persons face. Scared if they don't fit in or have the latest, the biggest, and the most expensive, the more it cost, the better they think. That is all because of technology, wasting time on the screen. The mind and body are effected, a lot of people slouch and have an arched back. A lot of back problems is the most I have been seeing around. I have back problems because of being arched a lot as a kid, it is only in time when everyone has an arched back and the ones with straight backs will be in charge. I say that because you can not stand tall if your back is arched. Technology has positive effects, it can help to find answers to your homework. You can find love, make a new life, find a new home even. Technology is not that bad it's just people misuse it and abuse it. It helps us, but it hurts us at the same time, and people don't see that.
