One topic that is frequently debated is if people should make their own decisions or seek guidance about life's important matters. People think that they should make their own decisions. They feel that it makes them learn from their mistakes and become mentally strong. I believe that people should seek guidance from experts because they know more about life's important matters, some people don't know how to make the right decisions, and they may help them with valuable lessons. Experts may know more about life's important matters than most people. They might've learned from experience or studied others, a class of sociology. They know if something is wrong with the person, if they had a bad day, and if they had slept. Some individuals don't really know how to make the correct choices, they often try to make the worst choices work, but that will never happen. They're afraid on what the good choices bring, if it brings good or if it brings worse. As you have read, it is strongly recommended that people should seek advice from experts, because we will not let others make bad decisions unless they are good ones.
