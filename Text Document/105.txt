The first impression is always impossible to change; I agree with this statement because most of the time people judge on yours you look, and it is always on the mind of the person for example:the kind of clothes that you had been dressed, the way that you speak and the face expression of that person. As, people dressed define their personality. If you have required to attend to a meeting at work with the bosses of your boss, and dressed that is necessity it's not appropriated, they may judge on you, and they could say that you are not a professional worker, or a formal person. To get full attention people format a good value adequate at the time of wave, meet, and speak with the other person. One reason is the major or important for people, and is the way the people communicated with others always matter because represent they selves. The expression with the face when someone meet others for the first time is never forget like when they heard your name, even the smile of the person most of the case represent the character of a person. All of all, the way that you present with others at the first is how you are going to be remembered, but are we good judge people only for the first impression that we made about it?.
