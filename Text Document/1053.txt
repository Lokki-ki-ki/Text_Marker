Although some say that school lunch menu don't need to be change because the new lunch menu would be more expensive, and some students throw the food, actually some say that will be a good idea to change the school lunch menu because some students declare that they sometimes received an expired food, so they think that food is from one year ago and some students say that eat the same food every year is bored because all students from high school are study four years, and some students start hate the food, and they prefer to take food from home, or they buy food like pizza, burrito, etc. and that is not good for health. Some of my classmate took the lunch, and they throw the food because they don't like the food, and they said that they prefer another type of food that school doesn't have anymore, and they did not think how expensive is that type of food, and they say if we are not pay we can throw all food. My little brother said that one time in lunchtime he took an expired milk and for that he said that he prefer to get food from home like chicken or buy in pizza and soda, and that is not good for him for that my aunt wanted talk with the principal if they can change the cafeteria menu for lunch. I have three year in High school, and I don't like the lunch menu because the last two years I eat the same food and for that I don't take lunch this year because I know is the same lunch and I prefer to take the food at home and, I don't take the lunch during the school. In conclusion, I think that schools has to be change the lunch menu because sometime students received expired food, and some of the students are bored to eat the same food every year.
