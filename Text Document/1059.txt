Is setting an example by your own behavior the best way to influence other people? Sometimes it is not the best idea to mirror other people's behavior because some people do not always have a positive behavior. There could be time's that someone could be in a negative place of mind, reckless, and does a lot of horse play; other time's people can be charming, properly mannered, and influential. Growing up in the Generic_City area, I have been able to witness a lot of drugs, gangs, and violence. The example these group of people decide to display is not a very positive act on their behalf; this is not a pathway you would want to be taking because of the bad outcomes from it. I remember I had a friend whose father shot himself due to the poor choice he made which made him reflect, and he figured that was the only solution. On the other hand, some people decide to be very influential to society positively. Out of my three years of high school I was able to see some students making their way for others by not being selfish; a lot of them did volunteer work as well to help the community and to hopefully inspire others to do so as well. I actually got the opportunity to throw a kid Halloween party at a church: I enjoyed it, it was a lot of fun. Honestly, I do not feel like I am a good example nor do I feel like I am a bad one either. I make mistakes: it is how I was taught. Growing up I believed that the only way you are ever going to learn is by making mistakes and being able to evaluate the error of your mistake; only then you can truly improve yourself and help inspire other people as well. In conclusion, I am mutual about examples being the best way to influence other people because of it not always being a positive thing due to the poor decisions some people choose to make. Truthfully I think it is a better idea to be the best you that you can be because at the end of the day there is only one of you and so many of us; it is best to stay unique.
