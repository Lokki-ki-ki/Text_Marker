Having good altitude is very important in life because that's what u would need to have in many things, childhood and adulthood etc. Why having a good altitude is very important is said for example, if your trying to apply for a job, It's good to have a good altitude at all times is because if your looking forward to get the job and have good dilute and be patient, there's a higher chance you will get the job? My second reason on why having good altitude is important is that say that u didn't get the job, always stay cool and not try the flash out on anyone or even put it on anyone because you can always try again and there's always jobs that are hiring and available. There are many benefits of good altitude, but few benefits are making friends, having a good life with no hate in your heart, get hired at jobs u apply at and many more. Benefits of having bad dilute can lead u to a place you won't like places like Jail if u talk back and not follow instructions or Evan go to jail for not paying your bills, get an office referral for not following directions and doing bad in school too. I've also witnessed bad altitude and good growing up. As in fifth grade I wasn't the best kid, but I made bad decision and talk back at the teachers etc. and that lead my mom taking away my PS4 so I can't play on it until I fix what I'm doing. Also, I remember when I was little, in church that if my siblings and I did good and behaved at church that my mom will buy us one candy each at a gas station of our choice, so we followed that and had good altitude throughout the whole church sessions continually throughout the times we attended church. Before my mother passed that's one of the many things she has taught me and my siblings to always have good altitude is because u can accomplish anything u worked hard at and respect people around you and a holy place like church. Now you know that having good altitude can effect not just you but people around you and your future.
