I think that people make their own decisions is technique good. I agree with that for 2 reasons. People have to improve their lives without help and guidance. People know which is the best decision by themselves. First reason, people have to improve in their lives without help or guidance. The people have to be independent, also the people have to follow their directions. Additionally, people know which is the best decision by themselves. The people have the responsibility to improve their lives or not, and the people will assume their own responsibility if their decisions are bad. Some people would argue that people don't have knowledge to have a good decision, and they do not have a guidance to follow; however, the people do not have all the time good decisions sometimes the people choose bad decisions, and the people do not have to have a guidance to follow. It's clear that people can make their own decisions. I strongly believe that people have the best decisions by themselves, and people have to improve in their lives without help or guidance.
