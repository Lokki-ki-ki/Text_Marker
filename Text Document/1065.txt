Have you ever thought what school would be like for you and other, students in your school would have a program where older and younger kids will gather around, do different activities and projects and learn at the same time. Think about programs you will want to be included in your school, that will help you learn faster and make you understand things better and differently, you will also get help and subjects you have struggles on a daily basis. In my opinion I feel like students feel better and coterie talking to students there age just because it might be easy for them to explain things better to someone who is the same age. There are times where student's feel more pressured by an adult so that's what makes them not want to ask for help. Now think to yourself and ask yourself if you find it better, having a program where all students can gather around just to ask for help when is needed and so socializes with them. Because theirs always time you get to school and talk to your everyday friends but you don't really know there's other people you haven't met yet so making a program for everyone is a good way to get to know others in the program. So with all that being said if you want to have a program at your school, that will help you and other student's gather around and bond together like friends and get to know everyone in your school. Is not just in the program that will be in your school but people that you walk by every other day gather around and teach everyone something new, and they can give back to you and teach you something new every day to anyone in the program. But back to the main starting point of the paragraph if you want to start a new program at your school talk to one of your teachers or your principle and share the ideas you have thought of or the ideas you have in mind and gather around to start something new and make school a better place.
