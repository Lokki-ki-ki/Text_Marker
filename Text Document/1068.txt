American teens love there phones they love to text and call all of their friends but this I starting to be a problem at schools all over the United States. Teenagers all over the U.S. text during class or during lunch. Phones are taken by teachers and taken to the office.The principal is reconsidering the schools phone policies:policy 1 Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch and other free times. Policy 2 Do not allow students to have phones at school.First, students should not be allowed to have phones at school because. Students are going to text during class. People might say, students won't use there phones during school because they are mature enough to follow directions but I say no some students might listen, but others are not going to care and use the phone. Next phones going off in class is a distraction for all the students and the teachers, but students might say that they will keep there phone on silent, but I say no students MIG
