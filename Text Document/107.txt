Some schools use cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes to allow students to use their phone in class, but also some schools doesn't like students having their cell phones in class or educational purposes. In addition, students can get distracted while the teacher is talking or just in general, but students should use their cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes because if student needs help finding a word, students can use for emergency, and students can use their phones to check on theirs grades and any missing work. First, If students need help finding a word, they can look it up on their phones for example, if the word is apple they can look for the definition and use it for resource. Second, if the student has an emergency therefor, students can contact their parents if the student isn't feeling well or any problems. Third, students can check on their phones to see if they have any missing work or any grades fix furthermore, if students can't remember if they turned in their papers, they can check on their phones to see if they turned it in. If the student has an F in the class and if students can't use their phone how will they know what grade they have in that class. In conclusion, I strongly agree to let student have their cell phones in the classroom because of those reasons. Some other students like listening to music while they work because they can focus better. The students also can prove that they use their cell phones wisely in class.
