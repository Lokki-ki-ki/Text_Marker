I Think that Technology is a positive thing. Because it help's people get there stuff done through the Internet internet has become a huge part in our life's because we use are phones for every thing. It's good that technology has improved because back in the old days' technology was not there but now. You can order anything online, and it will be there less than a week. nowadays if people are sick they can use there phones to look up how they can cure themselves. It has also improved because back then people couldn't FaceTime to see their relatives. But now they can see their family members from any foreign country.If you need to learn how to cook or bake all you have to do is look it up on Google, and it will show you pictures, videos.and also show's other recipes on how to cook other foods. You can mostly do everything line, and it's easy to do. Technonlgy has developed an easy way on how to gets huff done without leaving the house. Most people send most of there day in their phone watching videos. Socail media has also improved. A lot of people just post pictures. Some people like social media because it's like a newspaper it tells you what has been going on in people's life.it also shows funny videos and new stuff that people have invented. You can also talk and meet new people by texting and FaceTime. I believe that technology has taking over the world because some people can not live without their phone.
