Dear TEACHER_NAME I think the should let students use their cell phones during free times like lunchtime and in class when their teacher give them free time in class or during the morning because I think it's not fair because only teacher can use their phones and not use because what if we get an emergency call like the teacher, and we have to go home because that's what the teachers do when they get and emergency call they get sub and go home what if something like that happens to us what if someone has and an emergency like get hurt in p-e time or something else because that's why we get phones for an emergency so that's why I believe is better to let student's use their cell phones on free time or lunchtime or an emergency call because something might happen on time, or they want to talk to their friends on my space or internet to talk to their cousins or family or want to call their family to know what are they doing or if they are ok or if they need anything or if their parents are going to pick them up after school or have an appointment with the doctor and I think their phones need to turn off when they need to when the teacher tells them to turn them off because other students are going to get distracted and might not pay attention on what there doing, and they are not are going to do
