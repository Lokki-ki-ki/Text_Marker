It is possible to change your first impression, because not everything is how you might see at first, lots of things are different from you may think they are, so many people think that lots of things are bad, just because that is what came to their mind when they first saw it. We should never judge someone or some things on our first impression because we could be wrong, and miss judge things that we think is not right, we even have different first impressions on other people, without even knowing about them, or what kind of person he or she is. You could be wrong on some of the things that you may see because it might not be how and what we see, and you could have miss. In 10th grade I miss judged one of my friend because I thought he wasn't the person I want to talk to. Even tho I had some classes with him, I would not talk or be around him, because my impression was that he does not show respect not only to other students but teachers too, therefor I won't talk to him, so he would never know me and won't be mean to me. However, Later I realize that he was one of my best friend and the nicest person I had ever met, who I can trust and hang out with. Even tho, you may think that you can not change your first impression if you think about it, it might change your first impression.
