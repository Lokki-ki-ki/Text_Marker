Yes, I agree with this statement because If you try your best to believe on yourself it will make impossible, like applying for you first job or anything that you want to be for your career. Specially you need it when you are going to college that will help you to save more money, and you can get what ever you want. It will change your impression by how you get more skills like how to know yourself by finding jobs where you comfortable with. So that way when people want to know you by personality they will know that first impression it has impossible to change because you have made yourself to make it and think that you can do it like other people do, then you will realize that you made a good experience. Not everyone has a same first impression because they had different personality and idea for their self, some of them is not changing of their impression the reason why is they do not try them self what they believe that everyone has knowledge even if they can. The people who experiencing their impression that has already changed their lives, they are the one who having more self-confident and they're willing to sacrifices to spend time not for just wasting time. Based on this statement impression will change as impossible If they are being like kind a person do not really care about future career because they want to be useless as a person. They are not going to be successful with their achievement specially nothing can be change for their entire life.
