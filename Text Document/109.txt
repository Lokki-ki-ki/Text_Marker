I think that I would choose to be a nurse for the school to make sure that students will be safe in and out of school. I want It to be somewhere that students can come and talk to me what's wrong. Furthermore, I think that if I get this job I will take It and learn from it, so I would like to see the manger to see if he approves of It. I would also want to go to a good collage to get the education to be a nurse. It is going to be hard to get this job, but I am going to work for it as hard as I can. I also have to put in a lot of effort into this job to get it. It would at least take me about four years to be in a collage to help me study about how to be a nurse. Being a nurse will be difficult in a many ways, but it's a matter of learning of how to do something. I would say it's a better idea if I study longer it would be a most likely that I would get the job. More ways to be a nurse is by being organized because you need to know what the students need to become a nurse. Also, I would need to listen to directions because you can mess up because it's an important job. There are a lot of pros and cons about being a nurse because it's a job where you can mess up you can get into serious trouble. It takes a lot of time to be things that you want to be, but everything takes times, so I would say being something that you enjoy and think if you can do it. I would definitely want to be a nurse in a school to prove to the manager that I can do it. Hopefully the manager can take this into conservation if I could get this job. I would show to make schools better by having a fantastic nurse taking care of students when they aren't feeling well at school. I would like all students to feel safe to have a nurse that is there to help them when they aren't feeling great at school. Furthermore, I hope I can be a great nurse, and so I can get the job to become someone great in there school. Thank you and I hope I can the job.
