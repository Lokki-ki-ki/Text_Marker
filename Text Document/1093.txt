I agree with what has been said that a positive attitude is the key to success in the life. "Generic_Name, my son, remember, you always have to have a positive mindset." This is a quote that my grandmother kept telling me over and over again before I came to the United States. She used to tell me that negativity attracts failure. Throughout my life I have always looked at the positive side. For this reason I believe that having a positive attitude is the key to success as it assists in keeping resiliency, and courage, which are essential in accomplishing goals. We must have a positive attitude to be successful because it helps humans to be resilient. I have gone through numerous of challenges in my life including being homeless, but I always look at the good things I have, and think about those who do not have any support. A positive attitude helps people be resilient and confront everything that comes their way. Another reason why we must be positive is because being positive brings courage. Courage allows us to not give up when we want to accomplish goals. For instance, crossing the border is dangerous, however, with courage and being positive, I have been able to cross it. Now I am about to graduate high school. I have also been successful and will be an electrician, I could not accomplish this without a positive attitude. There are many people out there that think that being positive bring people's hope down if things don't go their way. But I do not agree. Being negative brings bad wives, and bad wives brings bad things this is why I also surround myself with positive people. To conclude, being positive is the key to success. I strongly believe this because positively brings resilient and courage. Resilient and courage are two characteristics that are important to succeed. In my life, I have been able to succeed because I have remained positive. So, I say, to everyone, think positive!
