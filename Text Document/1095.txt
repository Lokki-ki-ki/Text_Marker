Dear Principal, I agree with what you think but sometimes students need sport so that they can think better. I am in a sport and I wouldn't like to miss my sport. I believe students should keep playing sports, but their grade average should go up at least to a B. I am worthy that students grades will go up. Think about it's if the students are in sports because you nor their parents would want them out of the house to go with a group of bad people. So think about what I am telling you then write back. I hope you agree with what I am writing. Just think that you were a kid without sport and out in the street with those bad people. Sincerely STUDENT_NAME
