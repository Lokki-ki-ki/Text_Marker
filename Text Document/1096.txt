Some people might say that hiding your talent is wrong, but I think that it helps me to focus more and to develop it better. Singing is my talent, I love singing develop it by practicing, and I use it by writing my own songs.First, I love singing, my Talent, which I develop by practicing. For example, I am always looking videos up to develop my voice and practice, but sometimes I practice on my own. The more I practice, the easier is going to be for me to sing without any help, For me developing my talent is really important because my talent is my dream. Another example is that I go to singing lessons to practice and develop my voice, sometimes they give you some notes that you can use to practice at home, with the notes they give you, your voice is eventually going to sound clear focus and mature. Furthermore, I use my talent by writing my own songs, when Is my own songs the writing will give me an extra writing skill and most of the time some old memories come back. For instance, I usually write about my old memories, old feelings or the way I am feeling at the moment. Another instance, writing my own songs will give me an extra writing skill. By writing all the time you learn new techniques, new ways of writing or new lyrics. In closing, I use my talent by writing songs and that gives me extra writing skills, I develop my talent by looking up videos and by going to singing lessons. Also, my talent is my dream so I usually put a lot of effort on it.
