Dear Districts School:I am writing to express my support for the proposal to require that students can finish high school in three years. I am in favor of this proposal for two reasons. One reason I am in favor that students can finish high school in three years is because some students they don't be able to take elective class, and they don't have to waste their time to take another class. Most students can have more time to think and choose what career they want to continue to study. Since, they would like to go to the college and finish their career and get better job in their future. Another reason I am in favor of this offer is because students can have their opportunity to start to work more and save their money to continue to study. However, some students they don't have family or helper that can help to them to continue to study. Although, students need to work hard to graduate more early, but they have to keep this opportunity that this programs offer for them. Therefore, because this programs offer opportunity for students that want to finish their high school more early and if they want to continue to study they can take their time to work. I agree with this proposal of these programs that students can finish their high school in three years. Thank you for taking my support. Sincerely, Generic_Name
