I understand what are you tying to say about determine never to be idle which means not working or being used to not be idle you must do something every day to change you're life, and accomplish you're goals, which is I agree with for two reasons. One is if you have a goals' through the year something that you want to accomplish, or you have a dream you must start to take a step by step reviewing it every single day saying to you're self I can do it even though when nobody see you're work no matter how long it will take, but eventually you will get to that point where you want to be as long as you tying your best every day, and you will be successful in life. A lot of people want to accomplish their goals, but the thing is they don't actually take action why because they're afraid of fielders you can always win, but you can be the best as you could be, and you be never same again because you come this way if you don't do something every day your life will never change. Therefore, I strongly believe that if you are doing something everyday you will see the result at the end. your life will change, and you will accomplish you're goals. I fully support, and respect you're words, which is I agree with. Thank you for your consideration.
