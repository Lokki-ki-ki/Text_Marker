Do you think students should have a career plan by time thy enter high school ? I think no, because they can always change their minds., like if they end up not like the career they thought they wanted at first. And they pick a new one. In high school you have to take math and history and science and many other classes. And then you pick electives you are interested in. And high school students have to pass all there classes and some high school students have after school activities like staying after for extra help on subject or being on a school teams and clubs. And they just want to hang out with their friends and family and have fun and not to worry too much on what career they want to have in the future. And they might have other stuff going on. And i don't think it's a good idea to commit to a career at a young age because your interests change .and I think students shouldn't be expected to that early on. And it's not a good idea.
