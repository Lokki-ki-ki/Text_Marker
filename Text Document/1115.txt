When you have a goal, No matter how long it takes, and you complete, it will be the greatest accomplishment. To be yourself in this world that is changing over and over, you have to have a strong mind, a lot of people will not be agreed with what you have to do in your life, But people overthink everything people say, if you want to go higher than where you are; you will have to make some decisions in your life to make those greatest accomplishment that you want to finish and get to the top. I agree with this statement, because the time passes in your life is going with it, the more you do, the more you get and that is what people don't get, if you want to make accomplishments in your life you have to worked out man, For example LeBron James how do you think he went where he is now, Making steps in his life, goals, family help, you have all of if it is right there you just have to get it." To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else"... honestly I will not take it like is changing you, because you are the one changing your life, yes you will be seeing stuffs you will make some errors, but that is how you are going to reach what you want in life. You are going easy you will get it easy, and you will get it shipper too, if you work hard at the first time, at the end it will come easy, and you will be thanks full. A great accomplishment?, That can be anything, every one is a world, what I mean by that is that every mind have the power to do what it has to be done, either a teacher, family, friends, they are just telling you where is the door, your friends are not going to be opened for you, not your parents or teachers, you are the one who will open if you want to do it and get out, and get that goal or accomplishment that you have to complete. I can be an example for this, I used to hate school a lot, I went tot his time that I didn't wanna even go there, but there was this English 10 teacher that just speaking with me one day just one day, yes I was having F at that moment, after all that thinking a lot about what she said I passed her class at the end with a B, not knowing that I was going to be able to do it, but I did it just doing what I have to do, like I said people can just tell you where is the door you have to go get it."to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment", yes it is; put your self together get all the help you need if they are a good person they will help you, staying quit you will not get it, asking for help will not make you smaller it will make you stronger, and that is what we need be strong and get that goal or accomplishment done, thanks.
