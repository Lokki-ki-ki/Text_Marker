The first impressions are difficult to change because is something special that forever goes to stay in our minds for example when someone goes for the first time to the beach, it is the first impression and is as a picture taken in his mind that will never disappear, there are a bunch of impressions the people can not forget such a new father when he come in the hospital and look at his wife with the baby on her arms is something that is undeleted in the mind, good impression are alike to persuade the mind of the people, a beginner political always is trying to leave the best remain in the mind of the people to later get their votes because he wins because knew that leave a good first impression was the trick to convince them. The firs' impression can be used to persuade but also many times to hurt a person that is why always consider to be carefully at leave it. I am agree with the statement, never someone could have the capacity to change something have left recorded in his mind, I have examples for my opinions such as an immigrant who just pass through the border from Mexico and the border patrol path him up he's always going to remember that the border patrol did that his dreams stop because he was an legal guy, everybody has different experiences' no always the impression going to be to turn us in a happy mood, this stamens is quite real, everyone has to think about leave a good impression ever.
