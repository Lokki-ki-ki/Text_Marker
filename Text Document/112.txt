Some students would be more excited about having a longer summer vacation, it can give the students a longer time to spend with their families and friends, but if we think in a positive side it also means that having a longer break I could be most likely be a reward for those who has been studying hard throughout the whole entire year that deserves to get a vacation or a break of getting away from everything that has them stressing out over paper or either having to worry about their grades, which is good for students to knows how serious and important their education is so, they can success in the future all full of opportunities knowing what do to when it comes to face their problems alone base on what they have learn. For example in this Prompt educators thinks that students do not seem to retain what they have learn during the year when they are coming back to school after their break, they seem not know about anything or forget about stuff, which is true people to not appear to be thinking about things that might stress them out, instead they try to have fun with their loved ones, and of course try to read some books every other day or read the newspapers so you won't be left behind on what is actually going on in the world, perhaps we might forget about stuff younger people are faster learners and thinkers, can not be able to forget about important information that easy. Most of the students usually travels a lot during summer vacation out of the state, or they like to visit different countries, so yes basically what I'm trying to say is that a longer break or summer vacation is a good idea for those in specific who travels far away, so it can give them enough time to explore wherever they're going to be staying, and this can even be helpful for students to learn about different history, experiences, explore and these are some stuff that they can even share with their friends in school or with their teachers, that it can improve more their knowledge. Being away from school just for at least one month it can really effect anyone, I think that this could be effecting on just depending on how distracted you will be during the break, some students can't even call it a "break" or "vacation" because some of them would rather to take this time to earn a bit of money to be able to effort for their needs and expenses, or they might have responsibilities to take care of, Others likes to volunteer in community services or try to be involved in different activities that will keep you busy. In respond to everything I do think that having a longer summer vacation would be good enough to catch up as much as we can with our old friends and families maybe when we were in school we wasn't able to see them enough because some of our loved ones live far away from us, so we take our time to spend every little moment we have lost while we were way, and it benefits everyone in general, not just for students.
