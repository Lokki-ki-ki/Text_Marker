I think that my principal need reconsidering the school's cell phone policy.First, the principal should let allow all students to bring phones to school and use them only during lunch periods, free time, and when a student has an emergency. Because you don't if a student's mom is calling because an emergency happen.As you can see, that the principal need to let the student have there cell phone, as long as the phone is turned off during class time or is in bivariate. That is why the principal need to let us use the cell telephone during school.
