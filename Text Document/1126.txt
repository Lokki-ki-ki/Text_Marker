Why is it important to learn from the experience of others? Well it could help you in the future to make a decision or to pick in between stuff. I think it's fascinating to hear about other people back experiences. In overall if someone is trying to talk to you about their experiences you should pay close attention because it could come handy in life. One of the reasons why it's important to learn about other's experiences is because it could help you out in the future. For example if you encounter the same situation as them, you'll know what to do, in the other hand if you didn't pay attention to them, and you face the same situation they did you'll be clueless on what to do. If a friend is in trouble, or he needs advice with something you could help them out because of other's experiences. Another reason why it could be important to listen to someone's experiences is, so you don't make the same mistakes as them. When I was 8 years old my grandpa used to tell me that smoking wasn't good at all even tho he did it all the time, then my dad told me the same thing about smoking, so I'll always know that smoking it's not good for anyone's health and I won't make the same mistake my grandpa did. In conclusion, I think that listening to other people's experiences is good because it will help a lot in the future, and it'll help you make important decisions in life, and you could even help other people when they are struggling.
