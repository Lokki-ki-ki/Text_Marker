I think It's a perfect idea, And students they will benefit with this idea, Because they don't have to travel to school everyday, it will be a better option taking the classes only or video conferencing because is so much easier. And I think is more beneficial because i don't think, Students would want to travel everyday to school and back. I think students they will benefit with this idea, because they are not going to spend that much money, In traveling to school everyday. It will be so much easier taking classes only, because students will have more free time to do their own things, after they're done with all their schools work at home: for example; if the students works it will be a better option of taking classes only because he/she will have more time in getting ready for work, and been on time to work. Reasons why I say it will be a better option taking the classes only or video conferencing, It's because students they don't have to worry, about getting in trouble for been late to school, Because if students will travel to school school, there will be a high possibility of not getting to school on time sometimes it can be for many reasons; for example: traffic issue, parents they might get sick or any other reason, It will be really hard for these students if schools wouldn't offer away to study and learn at home, schools they make it easier for these students who aren't able to come to school, Myself as student I think this is a perfect idea made by the school, Because it gives students the opportunity of study at home when they aren't capable to show up to school for this type of reasons. I am agree with schools that offers distance learning as an option for the students, Because some students don't have the ability as others students, That has the opportunity of riding the bus to school every day from Monday to Friday, These students who take online classes is because they really need it, And they don't have a way of getting to school everyday, It might be more difficult for them, because they might not have someone to explain them as well as a teacher. Another reason why I think some students take only classes is because some classes that they like, some schools don't have them, and they really want to know about it, Also sometimes parents look brought schools to see the classes option they have online, so they can apply to see if their sons can take those classes online to learn about it. One of the major reason why student take classes online sometimes is that they don't have naught credits, so they have to take classes online, Because even if they come to school they won't be able to graduate because they don't have all the credits needed, Some students don't live near the schools to come all the way to school, so they decide to take the classes at home.
