Dear Generic_Name believe that working in a group is way better than working by yourself, get to do less work than working alone. Working with a group is more beneficial than working alone because when your working alone, and you need help there's no one to help you, but when you're in a group you get all the help you need. When I work by myself i usually don't get my work completed. Sometimes I be wondering what are we supposed to be doing. However, working by yourself in cress your chances of staying focused and productive. Although you got a better chance of getting a good grade when you work in a group. It all depends on the group if they like to work with each other. Also, you could easily get distracted by your own group mates, but the all depends on the group and the communication they have with each others. My final reason is that working in a group is better than working alone you get your work done faster than you usually would have alone. There for working in a group has more beneficial like make new friends and new people.
