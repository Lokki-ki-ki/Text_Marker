Imagine if community parks, state parks, and national parks provided a wide variety of interesting activities. Would you visit and tryout these activities? Would you tell a friend to come tryout these activities? I will be writing about two enjoyable ways to spend outdoors. One enjoyable way to spend time outdoors is by playing sports. I say this because everybody loves playing sports both girls and boys like to play sports. People can choose to play soccer, basketball, baseball, or golf. These activities are enjoyable because people like to be active and when their active they play sports they go outside to play sports. They can play in competition or just scoring points whichever way is best to have fun. Another enjoyable way to spend time outdoors is going to a pool. I say this because people like to swim when it's hot outside to cool them down a little. People can go to a community pool for people who know how to swim and for people who don't know how to swim. The people at the community pool can teach others how to swim, but it's gonna cost some money but its worth it. I say this is enjoyable because people like to have fun in the pool especially if it's during the summer. People can swim and play volleyball or play catch while in the pool to have fun. Inconclusion if community parks, state parks, and national parks provided a wide variety of activities people would go visit the place try them out and have fun.
