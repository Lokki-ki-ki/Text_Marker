A small kindness can change a person because if the person sees you helping someone he will know that helping is the right thing to do instead of doing nothing to help a person and that guy is Anna help than others will start helping, and before you know the whole country might help but if you don't choose to help, and instead you want to bully or be mean or hurt people, nobody is Anna help you or say to the person to stop instead they will start doing it, in life you have to choose a side if you want to be good or bad, stop bullying or help the bully, stop a person from hurting a other person or help them hurt that person you have to choose, if you choose "good" people will follow you and start doing it and respect you but if you choose the "bad" people will follow you but they won't respect you the way you want them to, and before you know the whole city or town will hate you from what you started.
