No I do not consider that extra two hours a day because it will be a little hard on the students.10 hours is a lot of hours for a student to be in school and each class would be 2 hours per lecture and that would be stressful and long. And also there wouln't be enough time for after school activities if school end at 5p. M and 85% of the students in school join a sport or a band, so if they do practices or the lesson will end late, and the students would be tried once they get home and there would be no time for their homework or if you have a test the day after it would be an convenes for me to stay up all night to study and get up a couple of hours later and go back to school. And just because the businesses extended there work week schedule doesn't mean student have to because the grown people that have a job its easy for them to work an extra two hours because they don't have all this extra responsibility a student has. Plus the people that work get paid by salary or hourly so it really doesn't matter to them their getting paid regardless if they work 2 hours or 10 hours and students don't. So I feel like it's unfair for yaâ€™ll to add extra school hours to student's.
