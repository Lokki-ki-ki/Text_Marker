Try your best' Many people say this sentence to people who have test or have their own projects. Because trying the best you can, will make better result than doing nothing. Like this, always doing something can accomplish more. More you tried, better result will come out. Such as Edison and many people who live successful life in our society. First, There will be many mistakes while making a decision. But we need to keep thinking of it and find a way. Example, Edison, who made a light bulb, do you think did he make it without mistake? No, there are a lot of failed experiments and mistakes. But he didn't stop to make it. He did keep practicing and, figure out other way to success making the light bulb. Second, in our society, there are a lot of people who accomplish more than others. Almost of them always did something like practice their experiment, find a way to figure out it, think about their purpose and each way to make it correct. Also, they wanted to solve question of their problems. People can't be inactivity to do these. Doing a lot of work, and never to be idle, can accomplish more. Third, some people can say 'There are people who didn't work that much but live successful life'. If there are? That people was really lucky. Almost of them, there is no one who accomplish more, without any effort. Idle people do not focus on their project then, how can they make the result better? Example, someone who practice every day and, work until late night will accomplish more than lazy one. Lastly, try a lot of things and keep doing something will make you grow. Sometimes inactivity can help you to rest and relax your selves but if we being more activity and always doing something, we can accomplish more.
