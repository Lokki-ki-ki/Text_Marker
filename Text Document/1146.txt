Do you want to know the reason why it is important to have someone who can share wisdom and experience with you? Well, I know there are a lot of reason. The benefit of having someone who shared wisdom and experience with you is that, people will show new things, you will get an opportunity to learn new things, and you won't feel like you are the only one who is experiencing this. When my friend shared how she overcome being alone, because she couldn't speak English well, I realize that I can overcome being alone too. It was hard for me to talk with the other kids, because I was afraid that they will laugh at me, because I couldn't speak well, and then my friend says "try to talk with them, otherwise you won't be able to speak with them,". After that, she told me If I want to communicate, I need to be confident. Like that, She shared her experience. The another benefit is that you can learn new things from the person who shared their wisdom to you. When they tell you about their experience, you will gain strength from it, and you won't be afraid to do new things. When the people who tell you about their experience see you doing new things, they will support you, so that your experience will be memorable. There are times when you feel like you are the only one who is experiencing this, but when someone tells you about their story, you will feel that you are not the only one who is feeling like this. When they shared their story, you will gain an opportunity to make new friend. You two will share your feeling about the experience and become closer. On the other hand, the funny and the sad stories will make you two have fun while you talk. Since you know that there are a lot of reasons to share your experience, I wish you could use them to share your wisdom in the future. Don't you think it is the time for you to seek and ask other people's experience?
