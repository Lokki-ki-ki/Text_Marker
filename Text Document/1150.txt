I agree with Albert Schweitzer" Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is he only think." Setting an example to others it's the best way to influence others because for example there are two students named Generic_Name and Generic_Name. Both of them are in the same school. Generic_Name has good grades he is always doing his school work, never dose anything to upset the teachers or get in tenable while Generic_Name is the complete opposite. Generic_Name has poor grades, always talking back to his teachers and never dose his school work he also gets in to fights with other students. Generic_Name has an idea he wants to help Generic_Name to become a better person and influence him to do well in school. Generic_Name have the same first block class as Generic_Name. Generic_Name decided to get bad grades and talk back to his teachers. Generic_Name is doing all of this because he wants Generic_Name to realize just because you have bad grades in school that does not mean you can not change that. The next day Generic_Name gets good grade he apologize to his teachers and Generic_Name seas Generic_Name having bad grades and the next day Generic_Name change that and started doing good aging. Generic_Name thinks to him self if Generic_Name can change so can I. The first thing he does is to go and apologize to his teachers for being rude he started studying, getting good grades. The moral of this was that someone's behavior could have an influence on others this is why I agree with Albert Schweitzer.
