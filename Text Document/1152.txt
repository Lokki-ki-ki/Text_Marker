When people ask for advice, they mostly don't talk to one person they talk to more than one. This can help you and other people to make a better choice. They can give you more opinions. You would have more people to talk. They all have different ideas. One reason that can help you and other people to make a better choice is talking with more people other than one. When you are talking to more than one person they have more opinions than one person. Making a circle and talking about what you think is going to help you make a better choice could help more than one person. If you think that one opinion is not going you make you do a better choice you have another choice to make. Talking to more people for advice. They could have different ideas that you can help you with the right choice that you want to make. You can hear different people talking and not only one. If you and other people think that the choice that you are going to make is not a good choice you have more than one person to talk to. You would have more people that will help you with your advice.These is my reasons why this can help more people make a better choice. They are many more reasons that can help people to make a better choice. If you are talking to one person they are going to help you but if you are talking with more than one person. You have a better chance to make a good choice.
