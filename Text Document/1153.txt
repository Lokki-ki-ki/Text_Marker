' Why do we have to go school for eight and a half hours for five days per week? We can't do anything after school!'' Please imagine that situation. If that situation became for real, how are students going to react to it? Of course, they are going to be mad, and they might have more stress. Therefore, although some people agree with adding one and a half hours to school each day because students can have time for studying, and it is very educational for them, I disagree with that idea because it interferes their family time and after school activities, and it is going to become cause of they have more stress.First, students can't have time for family and other activities. At recent, many kids hang out with their friends than families especially teenagers. I think students should have more family time to having great relationship with their families. Additionally, some students have activities after school. Activity is an essential way to relax and have fun, and it also helps students find new hobbies and make new friends. As a result, if adding one and a half hours to school, it steals a lot of wonderful opportunities from students. Second, it gives more stress to students. Some students have large amount of stress already. During the school week, they study for about seven hours per day, and sometimes they need to work on project and study for quizzes and tests. Also, they have homework at least one subject every day. That's why students have a lot of stress. To decrease their stress, school needs to give a time to relax for them after school. In conclusion, adding more time to school has many disadvantages for students. Students need family time and time to work on their activities after school to have fun and relax. School is not a place that give a stress to them. School is a place that give an opportunity to get interesting knowledge to them. I believe school should overrule this idea if you think about students.
