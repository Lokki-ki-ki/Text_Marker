I think is a good idea that the students start thinking about what they want to study in the college, what they want to be in the life, and they start preparing for the future in the high school. It is a good idea because they can start working when they are really young, It is a good idea too because they can make money when they are young, It is a good idea because they can buy they own things with their own money, like a house, a car, or whatever they want, and they can get graduate really young and that is the way to prepare you for something. For example, you can stop living with your family you can be indecent, nobody can tell you anything you can rent your own room just for you, and you can have your own space, another example is that you are young maybe you make a wrong decision in the career that you choose, but the good option is that you are young you already did the high school maybe you already work, so you have money you can start another career more important something that these time you already liked because you are older you know more about what you really want. Also in the work that you have you can study a little more, and you can scale to another position too much better when you are young you're body don't feel so tired when you work because you have more energy, but when you are older your body start feel tired, you start loose energy the sickness come your body hurt you have to go more to the doctor, so when you are young you can work more for you retirement. In conclusion is a good idea that the students start commit a career at a young age because that are going to help them to be someone in the life, also that are going to help them to be an important person. But the more important is that you are going to work in what do you love to do. The benefit of start preparing for a career since the high school is that you are going to be a young with a lot of experience, also that help to the young students stop thinking on bad things, like cigar, tobacco, alcohol etc. Also help them keep their mind busy and to be in high school and not in the streets with bad friends that help them to keep an educational way. And is something that they are going to use in the life and is something that is good, what we need now is a societies based on education because that is a good thing because the education come with a lot of opportunities and with that opportunities the students can lair a lot, the learning is the best thing on the world.
