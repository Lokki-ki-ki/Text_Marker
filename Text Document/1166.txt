The technology had negative and positive effects on people's lives, because not all people know how to use correctly. One of he positive affects that technology had is that people can get their on stuff without contacts with others people. But also this has negative effects on people lives, For example had the limitation on humans contacts. The limitation on human contacts is one of the bikes problem in the society. Every time the technology advance more and faster, and every time it is more involved in our life, changing the dynamics of society constant. This also affect people in many ways it can be said that it is a threat to humanity because is make them dependent. For example people that how like to do all their work at home they do not like to contacts with others, people they just have contact with their self and on my opinion that is not a good way, because you need to had contacts with the other peoples to understand how to do the work or any question that they have. People had developed technology as an aid to civilize, acquire more knowledge, expense their social relationships But some people misuse it and abuse it by killing and creating threats to humanity, so the world could be in crisis. In completion, The technology had a negative effect on the society just for people that who know how to use correctly or because they think that technology is everything, and they can do everything with the technology.
