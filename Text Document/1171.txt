Why having a good attitude tours someone can have good causes? Having a good attitude tours someone you just meet, can bring good actions like a great friendship or relationship, a reason for a person that wants to hang out with you is because that person thinks your great person, and they would like to spend more time with you because you give them a good impression to them, and they think you a great person. For example, let's say your mate wants you to meet his or her parents, so to give them a good impression you would have to, have a good attitude tours everything they say in order to give a good impression to them. Another example can be work, having a good attitude at work can be a lot less stressful and more positive in your life and others coworkers because you're not complaining of how difficult your day was, they have it difficult too, but maybe not having so much stress in your mind or complaining how life is treats you, you can even hang out with your friends or your coworkers time to time and make new friends or people like you even little more because at the end of the day everything would still be the same so be more positive. So having a good attitude tours your friends, family or coworkers can lead to positive outcomes.
