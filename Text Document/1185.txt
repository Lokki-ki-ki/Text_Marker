Should people make their own decisions, or should they seek guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matters? In my opinion, I think that people should seek guidance form experts and authorities, for many reasons this solution has proved to be effective, if a person listens to other people opinions, then the decision the person makes will not be base only on his/her opinion. First, let's say if a male person seek guidance from experts and authorities when taking a decision, it shows that he is obedient, and he will not act recklessly when taking a decision about his life, it shows that he is willing to listen to other people perspectives. Second, in my opinion I think that asking for guidance shows awareness, it shows that you care about yourself and others opinion, it also shows wiseness when you ask others for guidance first, so you can decide and make the best decision. In conclusion, people should seek guidance from experts when taking a decision about their life, I think that if people set aside their pride and worries, we humans would make better choices not just for us but for our entire environment which it also includes other species.
