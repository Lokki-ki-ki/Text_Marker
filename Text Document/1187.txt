Do you think that the programs of graduate in three year is a good way?some school need student that they have online classes, and they can graduate before than three year for one part the program of graduate in three year is not good, because is harder, My brother need help for teachers for graduate, and in the school classes he learns more, and he pay many attentions to the teacher because he wants graduate in three year etc. Some students take this program in summer school, because they want to finish the high school in three year, and go to the college in less time. The program of graduate in three years is not good because student need help for the teacher, student learn more with teacher help, and they pay a better attention etc. The program of graduate in three year is good, because you graduate in less time, and you can go in summer school for graduate the next year, but is harder, more responsibility, and more work etc. Should the school districts offer these programs? This programs offer many opportunities to graduate in three years, so I think that this is good for student, and they can have more opportunity to graduate in three years.
