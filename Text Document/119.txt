Should be students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? Well, I think students can be benefit this program, if they can work at home by the way of online or video conferencing, because students have more opportunity to study like have more time to work, they don't need to walk or take a bus to come school, can be more effect to students, students can feel better when they try to story because in his home there is no people talking a lot about things, but people talking not about the class.Also, student can choose the time to they can star the classes, because some students have to work in a job, so when is cold outside and students they don't like to come school, they can port at home by the way of online or video conferencing, students can be more responsible or maybe not is depend what class of student are you, but the things is there are a lot of reasons of benefit for students can have that classes. Some students feel good working at home, there is not streets for them, they can take a break, they can eat and his work. They spend more the energy of his mind etc... I think the best option for students to attend classes from home by the way of online or video conferencing to learn. But also is depend what classes student do you are, because some students are lazy when they work at home. Also parent can check his work in look if they do his work good or bad, take classes online is one think like because for me is more easy to do my homework, so conclusion students have benefit from being able to attend classes from home.
