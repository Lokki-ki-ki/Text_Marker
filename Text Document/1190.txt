Identify a talent or skill you have, and explain how you develop and use it. Everyone has a talent and a skill. I personally think that my talent is photographing, but photographing take skills as well. Taking pictures is relaxing, fun, and cool at the same time. Photographing is I guess not easy and hard because while taking pictures you have to find the right angle the photo and as well you can just take your picture in your own way. How I developed photographing is by going out and looking at intense images. When I go out, I always think about if I should take some photos of what's there like: the Alderpeople, and maybe other Cities as well as Nature. While taking pictures, it's really relaxing because you can feel the wind breeze on your face, and you can release your stress. For me, I think that its fun because you can take pictures whatever you want, I also think that taking pictures is cool because you can see how things looks like up close how it looks like on camera. How I use it is by releasing everything that is on my mind. I also use it for improving my skills as well. For me sometimes it's a little hard because I need to find the right angle for the photo I'm taking. My photograph skills aren't that good, but I practice everyday, so I could take better images. During my free time I go out and find some photographic things like: Insects, the Moon, and other objects, and take pictures of them. To conclude, in my opinion I think that photographing can be your talent and your skill as well because if you like looking at intense images then you can take an intense picture too, or you can take it just for fun. Besides, maybe you can try to see how your photograph skills are too.
