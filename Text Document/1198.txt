Technology allows people to complete many tasks without having contact with others, but the use of the technology had cause negative effects on people's lives because, people spend time on video games, people became antisocial, and it is less helpful.First, people became addictive playing video games, and they spend too much time on it. Video games take you out of contact with others. With the use of technology daily affect people's vision, with the time people use glasses. Secondly, people became antisocial with the use of technology because, people prefer to spend their time on the internet than having a conversation with their friends. People used to have communication with others by the technology instead of hangout or doing any activities with them. The majority of the people prefer to shop online, and lost their time thinking if the clothes is going to fit them, instead of go to the store, try the clothes on and see if is a good idea to spend the money. Finally, the use of the technology is less helpful and have a negative effect on people's lives because, the technology take people out from the real world, for example if people shop online, and they have questions they have to wait to long to get their answers, but if they were at the store a worker would help them. The use of the technology affect the communication with other people. In conclusion, technology allows people to complete many tasks without having contact with others, and it can be faster; however, the use of the technology affects people's lives, and the communication between two o more person. In my opinion people should use less technology, and enjoy conversations with their friends and family.
