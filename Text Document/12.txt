Technology allows people to do many things such as order things online, play games, and contact other people in a faster way, and if your family members live far away they be able to contact them.I believe that it has a positive effect because everybody needs to stay in contact with there family that lives far away, and be able to order online is a real help because if people Oder there groceries online then they want to have to wait in the long lines at the store to check out instead of waiting they can also get more items that the store don't have the food or items people. Others may argue that technology is a negative outcome because lots of people let it take over there lives and act like they can't go anywhere without it and lots of people try to be on there technology when they are driving which is a bad thing to do because they will end up getting into an accident. And if the older generations won't know how to use the technology. In conclusion, having technology is a positive thing because it helps lots of people out, and it makes getting things done way faster.
