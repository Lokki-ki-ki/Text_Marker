I agree with the statement because the first impression that we make can't be change complete even the try to change. First impression is something no one can forget it can be attitude, love, feel but with all this impression we can not forget or change even we went to it will not be the same to impress someone with an ex we are attitude they ways we talk, walk even eat no one can change and someone tries to impress his love to a girl he has been in love since children even someone come out of nowhere he will not be able to change the first impression of this person. When we make the first impression to people even we know they will try to copy or change it will be impossible because everyone knows the impression it is not something that we can change even we change it is not going be the same an example Generic_Name tried to impression Generic_Name with her food Generic_Name love it and went to make the same food it will be the same, but it will not taste the same way because he doesn't know what kind of ingredient she put in, and even she tells him it will not go taste the same, so every first impression can not be change. We have known what it is a first impression are almost impossible to change because its kindly like feeling no one can change because impression is something we do to impress people with what we have sometime is not even real or fake but some time we think it's real, Generic_Name lied about her personality and family to try to impression hers friends in school they will believe her, so impression can be sometime a lie but impossible to change. We need to understand that first impression it something that is impossible to change, and we need to believe in our self and not try to change other people first impression or copied them it will be painful to retry even to we have known, but it will not go to be the same.
