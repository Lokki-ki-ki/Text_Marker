The famous scientist Albert Einstein said, "Imagination is more important than knowledge." This is especially true for today's world. Even with seven billion people on Earth, everyone is unique. Your imagination is vast; an open plain of wondrous ideas and possibilities. This leads to even more diversity than our physical differences. It is also applied to our day, and it makes it more lively. And while knowledge is powerful, imagination can make it far stronger. Imagination is more important than knowledge because of creativity and experimentation. First, imagination leads to creativity. Your can put your ideas to life through creativity, and there are plenty of ways to do so. You can construct a masterpiece of your choosing, whether it be art, music, or even writing! Even thousands of years ago, creativity makes its mark. Rough drawings by cavemen depict tales of hunts and adventures. Beautiful artifacts and pottery dot museums. Ancient literature such as Beowulf and The Odyssey still fascinate modern writers. And recently, artists and musicians such as Bob Ross and Duke Ellington have made amazing pieces through their creativity, just like the legendary Leonardo da Vinci and Beethoven. Time wears things down, but not imagination. This is immensely important as creativity allows you to express yourself. You can voice out your thoughts and ideas in so many forms. With imagination being limitless, so is your creativity, and so are your possibilities. Next, imagination leads to more experimentation. Going mad-scientist isn't recommended, but you can poke around with new ideas and find a new talent or hobby. More experimenting can lead you to find something you really enjoy! Trial and error can be disheartening, but don't give up! You could find something that could change your future. It can be fun too; testing different paths to a single destination. Not only can you find the best road to a goal, but you can spread the knowledge to others. The results from tinkering around varies from little things to giant discoveries. Take Damascus steel for example. The forging process for the metal has been lost, which has consistently frustrated modern metallurgists. A steel from times long gone, but still baffling today's scientists. That's a pretty amazing feat! Experimenting from your imagination is wild, but it's enjoyable and even rewarding! However, some say knowledge helps daily life more than imagination. Valuable things, such as language, mathematics, history, and science. Knowledge does help with life, but most of the things you learn are often useless or forgotten along the way. Math and Language Arts are important, but unless you're pursuing teaching or poetry, some aspects aren't very useful. For example, being acknowledged that plants are green because of chlorophyll isn't going to help with paying taxes. Imagination can make life better and enjoyable. Decorating your house or doodling a picture can be more relaxing and fun than first thought. In addition, most of the knowledge obtained can't be applied without a good imagination. And while some people may have an upper edge in academics, everyone is on equal ground in imagination. In conclusion, being able to experiment and create with limitless possibilities makes imagination more important than knowledge. Making ideas come to life is fun and shows what you're capable of. Creativity holds the ever-important ability to express yourself. Experimentation is enjoyable and can be rewarding. You never know what you can do unless you try, and testing your skills is a great evaluation. And all of this traces back to one thing everyone has: an imagination.
