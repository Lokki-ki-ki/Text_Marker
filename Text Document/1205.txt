It has been said that a positive attitude is the key to success in life. I'm agree with this statement, I'm one of the persons that think that a good attitude can open many doors to anyone. Example: If to are looking for job, and you are talking to the person who is going to give you the job, and you are being with a negative attitude, and being arrogant they person is going to think more about it. Example: If your attitude is ban positive, and you are being nice with they person his going to be nice also, and you would have more possibility to get it. A reason of why you need to be with a positive attitude, is because life is more easy by they way your main is out of stress, but more important you would be always happy. And my last opinion, I defeat this position because, year's ago I was with a very negative attitude and always thinks happened to me, and i always was like why this is happening to, and one day I say is enough and I was about to finish with my life and i don't know what happen that from they day I change my main, when you do think with a good attitude everything is going to be better.
