Ralph Waldo, Emerson, wrote "unless you try to do something beyond hat you already mastered, you will never grow." I agree with Emerson statement these are my reason why. First, I think if we do not prepare for more than one thing. We will never grow up. Second, have more than one knowledge than other people always will be advantage. Last, if we do not try more than one thing that can be more hard of that we already know. We will never grow. First reason, i think if the people do not prepare their lives with more than one knowledge. Their lives will be without direction, and with less opportunity in our society, because they will do not have the enough knowledge to play a good job. For example, if they are looking to find better job with new experiences that will be impossible to find for them, because they do not have the knowledge which one is required for the position. How they can be productive for the country or society. If they are not prepared to make done specific job that can be important. Second reason, when we have different knowledge our lives help us a lot to find the best or easy jobs. The knowledge is the most power thing the human being can have in their hands. Some people think the knowledge is something that we can not buy from anywhere. Example, if you focus to learn. You always will have advantage to grow. Last, I think if the people never try something hard they will never grow. We always need to try something who will bring new experiences on our lives. Example, when someone is going to university and the person graduated from teacher, but if he stuck there, and not go for more hard profession he will never grow like principal etc. Conclusion, I agree with Emerson statement, because he gives to us specific ideas what is life about when he said "unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow. This is why I agree to his statement, and I provide all this reason.
