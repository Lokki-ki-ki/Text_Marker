I think that this is wrong for the students sometimes, because they can't learn the iPhone is one thing for that they can't focus on the school. When the students use the iPhone in a moment important when the teacher is teaching something they can't understand because the never put attention to the teacher, and is very important the school because you can be someone better the , you can have a good future and don't matter what. We need to do everything for get a good job, and make money, but if the teacher never put a stop or don't help to the students they never do that .the technology is something that have to the all person now all one want to be or use the iPhone for everything, the people need understand that all is in our mean we can do with only think and want to. Everyone needs to finish with this problem with the phones and do something change the things that affect we live. One day everything can be different to now.
