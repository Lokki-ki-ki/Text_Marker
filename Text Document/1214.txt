Thomas Jefferson believes in that doing something is better than doing nothing. We do accomplish more if we always do something. There are great accomplishments and there are simple accomplishments. If I wanted to play an instrument, but I don't know how, so I learn how. Let's say I want to see other detentions' worlds', or go back in time. Let's say I build a machine to be able to do that. Cleaning the house, Cooking a meal, and doing homework. If we are always doing, then we can accomplish. We accomplish more by doing something. If we didn't, we wouldn't have the things we do now. We can accomplish things' as a team or individually. Like sports, in sports people work together to win. A game company, these people work together to make a game, so that people can play it. In a game people play together online to win as a team or individually. It's better if we do our work, homework, or even little things like play outside, hangout. Inactivity in its a own way has a purpose resting or sleeping, relaxing. If you do that you let out that steam. We take a break after working hard on something. So we do what we have to do for a couple of hours, we go home, we can take a nap, eat, watch a bit of TV, or sleep. That way the next day you can be motivated to continue doing your job, or go to school. If we do even a little during the day we've accomplished like to go out and buy groceries, clean the house, and cook. If you do that then you've accomplished something. You can't really do anything if you sleep all day. Being lazy is not good. It's bad, because if we get lazy then we'll want to have the easy way out of things all the time. We can get used to at being lazy. It's better to be active and motivated to do the things we have to, so we can accomplish something.
