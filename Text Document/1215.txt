Students should commit to a career at a young age because they will have more knowledge about their career, have more experience, and if they don't like it they could change it before fully committing to it in college. Being committed to a career early can help you be prepared when you officially start it. If they start in high school they will have more experience about the career and might be able to get a lot more job opportunities. The more experience you have, the more you'll get paid. They will also be able to focus on their career before college and have more knowledge about it. Some people say you shouldn't commit to a career at a young age because if they don't like it, they just wasted a few years preparing for a career that doesn't interest them anymore. However, if they don't like it they can change it before entering college and have to pay for a career they don't even like and doesn't interest them, that's why it's best to start committing to a career in high school. Also, when jobs look at your resume and see you took classes in high school for that career and a lot more experience they will wan to higher you. When people see that you are committed to your career at a young age they respect you more and help you out to achieve your career faster. It's best for students to commit to a career at a young age because they will have more time to learn about it and see if that's the career they actually want in a few years from now.
