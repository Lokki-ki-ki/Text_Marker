I supported that people make their own decisions and here's why. You can learn your own expression, that you can learn something new on your life like building your own home or learn how to run a town for mayor. Following your instincts that can help you bypass tough problems like how to escape from a hole or how to dodge a ball perfectly. Follow your own path to see who or what to see the true you are. I don't hate getting help from others to seek guides, but I personally prefer it because it would be challenging for me instead of taking the easy way out, if I did what did I learn something? Nothing that is why I would like to learn something on my own. Another thing here is that if you seek guides from others, it's a helpful way, so you won't struggle a lot and that is alright, that you cannot do everything your own which is fine.
