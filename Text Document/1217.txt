Me as a student think that we should have at least a (C) because most students use sports to express their feeling out. Sometimes if they don't get what they want they will just stop trying; in school work or even homework. But in the other hand some other students will try harder, so they can play or do what they love. So a (C) sounds good but a (B) sounds even better; so students like me could try even harder and have a modification to so. So I say to the principal great gob and keep it up. When we are looking back and when we have a great job that we like; we look back to middle school and say thank u for pushing us to max when it came down to doing work, THANK YOU.
