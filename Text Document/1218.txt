I agree with Prime Minister Churchill because failure gives you strength to keep going and to learn from your personal mistakes you make, so you can succeed in life. While I was a kid all I ever wanted to be been an actress. I would try for plays in school and out, but I failed to be in the plays because I was too nervous, quite, not using the whole stage, etc. That inspired me used all those factors that where making me fail and improving them to make me a better actress. In school/classroom always fail in sols, test, and quizzes, but those students never give up trying and after trying and studying students succeed in their test. In a community everybody tries to help out trying to catch people that break in peoples houses, but never do. The people made a list of the things they were doing wrong, and they very upset people stopped trying. Until one day one person broke in to a house and instead of doing nothing like the people said the made a successful plan to catch the criminal. The planed worked and then community celebrated their success and for not giving up. One of the most famous soccer player in the world Lionel Messi also has failed on the field whether it is on penalties, shooting, or speed he always tries to be better and all his failure has made him one of the best soccer players in the world. In this world you become better on what you do by failure. If there is no failure there is no success.
