To me its more beneficial working as a group. I have a few reasons why its better working with a group rather than working alone you can learn from one another also be motivated to learn as a group. Making new friends can be tough but when you are but in a group you can make friends with each other. One thing in a group that can be good and bad is having discussions with the group. There are many reasons why I prefer working with a group and I'm hear to share with you. Working with a group is all about sharing new ideas and discovery with your group that some people didn't know about. With a group everyone would get good grades and ace their exams. Some people in your group may have the same interest as you and would like to study that objective more and being motivated by one another. In my opinion working with a group is simpler and fun at the same time and kids will enjoy learning that way. One small little problem about working with a group is having discussions about the subject that the group is talking about. They with all disagreements but also agree with each other. The group tends to get mad maybe because someone in the group said something the other didn't like and would have an argument. There are more pros than cons in working with a group for sure. Everyone has a different saying if It's beneficial to either work with a group or work alone. I'm not at all saying working alone is a bad thing on the contraries its also good because sometimes you might not get along with the group you got sand with and you just want to do your work alone. Working in a group though brings you softer as a school and there's nothing better than working in a team.
