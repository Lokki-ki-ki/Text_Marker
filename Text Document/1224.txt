Although the extra time would benefit students. Some people don't want to stay after school because they are already tired from staying 7 hours at school. Because school can cause stress if you are forced to do much work. I disagree because the school board is adding it to our day. They should add an after school program for kids who need help with homework. Because if they add it for everyone then we would get out of school late. And we would barely have time to do homework. On the other hand if they add it everyday then a lot of kids will be stressed. Because when they come back if they have homework, or projects to work on then they might stay up all night working on it and come to school the next day. And they will probably be grumpy or stressed. My second reason is The teachers will also be tired and stressed because if we leave school first. Then that means they leave after us. Also, they have to grade our papers and other stuff so adding extra time to school will not be a great idea because the teachers can turn mean from all the stress. They can sleep from being too tired and then that means we won't get to learn anything. And don't forget that the teachers have a normal life too. They have families that they want to see so if the school board adds extra time then that teachers might not see their families often because they will probably be too busy grading our work. So I think that the school board should not add the time. Because if they do then they will mess everything up like people's sleep schedule, The time they might go somewhere. So over all I think that the time we leave school right now is good. Because people have enough time to do their work and projects, and to get enough sleep. So the time we have now is good because everything is balanced. But if they did change it then we would have to get used to changing our sleep time and doing school work.
