I think working with a group or working alone it depends on the person because everyone is not a same. I feel strongly that I don't like work alone because its very boring and takes long time to finish work. However, I do like to work with a group because It's so much fun, and you will experience with others and its easier to do something. First, Working with a group is so much fun especially when you are something with your best friends. When you are work with your friends they make you laugh so hard and we do the lot of fun things together. Some of my friends actually works well with other people. When I have a free time I like to play games with my friends. In the game you will team up with your friends and play against another team. You have to talk to your friends every single time and lesson to their idea to win game. Most video games needs to be perfect team work. You can't do anything by yourself. Second, When you are working with a group you will interaction and feel the other people. Its like social experience. Talk to your team-mates, lesson and support their idea. Working a group is way better than working by yourself. If you are learning English by yourself It's very hard but if you had a teacher then it's much easy to learn and quicklyFinally, You can do things very quickly because there is a more than one person working. If your mom say's clean your house. You have to clean entire house by yourself, and it takes long time to finish but if you clean with your brother or sister then it's quite faster than clean by yourself. Although, I like to work with a group of people because It's so much fun, and you will experience with others and its easier to do something.
