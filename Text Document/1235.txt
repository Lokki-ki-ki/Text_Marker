School districts offer programs that allow high student to graduate in three years time because it helps student to start planning about what they want to do in college and what course they are going to take in college and to start planning how to get scholarship, student aid, student loan, etc. for college. Some advantage of three year program is you can't stay too long in school in and that is great for me because school is boring and full of too much stress especially when you have to come to every day even if you don't feel like come you still have to come.spillway when you don't have friends in school is very boring. L know school is fun, but the same time is stressful were you have teacher giving you lot of assignment. But in college you have your own scheme and is your choice to choose which day you like to come to school. You don't have to worried about friends every one will be nice to you and in college you have study group where can join socialize with others. Many people may that going very soon is not a good idea for them because don't want to leave their friends the making a new is going to be hard for them. Well I don't think that is the reason for you not to go I mean you can still come and see if you want. So finish school in three year time is a good Idea to me.
