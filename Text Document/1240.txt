One of my favorite middle school subjects is Math. Why Math is important because you will need to learn math thought high school and middle school even elementary school math is also important because math all the time in school and out of school to count money everything. For example, you go to the store and get groceries the total would be whatever money it is and you'll pay, but you need to know how much math you have to do. What if you know how to do math, and you need a lot of help to count an amount of a number and if there's no one to help you have to use a calculator and other things. If you were to pay rent or something when your older it would be harder, so you need math it's better for everyone. Math is meant for everything sports to count how many players there are to know a play for like a playbook. That's why Math is important in school and out of school.
