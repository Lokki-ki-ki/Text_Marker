Have you ever wondered how people are perfect at playing an instrument? Have you ever thought what is used to make an instrument sound soft, low, and/or relaxing? Well I've found a perfect instrument that might seem easy but it's actually difficult to learn and to play in front of judges. One of the most played and enjoyed instrument in a educational school, concerts, and even TV shows is a "Violin". Violins are a really enjoyable and interesting to watch. But have you ever thought how hard it could be for a person to learn the music and strings? Well learning the music it's hard for some. Mostly if you don't know what string plays what. The easiest strings for people are the "D" and "A" strings. These strings are mostly used in every sheet of music you get. Movies play a lot of orchestra music. Not just regular music but "Action" movies. Why you might ask, well when an intense part starts the movie plays a soft violin. When the movie is getting closer to the part they play 2nd violin, Hello and Bases. Hello and bases are loud and deep reasons why movies like to play them a lot. Have you ever went to an Orchestra concert nearby? Well if you have you probably know how loud they get. Well a side from Orchestra Violins playing in movies, orchestra also has their own assessment every school year. An "Assessment" is basically were an orchestra teacher gets to pick 30 students from their advance class and take them on a mini "field trip" representing the grade level and school's orchestra. What students basically do is play in front of professional judges from different counties. They rate your performance from 1 being the best, to 5 being the worst. That's basically what a violin and orchestra classes have.
