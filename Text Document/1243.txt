Schools have partnered with local companies to let students explore the certain professions that local workplace perform the type of work you would like to pursue. Many school pay to have a partnership with local companies some companies don't want to be partnership with the schools that are paying to be partnershiped with the company. Sometimes local companies come to the schools and ask them to be partnershiped with the company some even ask for just a field trip with the kids to explore the work or company to see what they have in the jobs and see what they do nonstop every day for just work and getting paid after a whole day of work. Schools are wasting money to just get partnershiped with a company and also companies are wasting money for asking the teachers for a field trip to go see the jobs what are going to do to stop the paying money part I know how about ask the teachers for a field instead of paying the teachers and begging them to do the job that they're going to take the kids to the job after you're done.
