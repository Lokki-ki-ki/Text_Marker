Today I'm going to share my thoughts about Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment. I would say yes is the greatest accomplishment because if you're trying to be someone in the world, but you have no body to be with you is want to be more difficult but if you try your best you can make it but if you have like people with you that is trying to help you is want to be more easy, so I think to be your self in world that is constantly tying to make you something else it's one of the greatest accomplishment. I would say is true because to be yourself around people that is negative is want to be difficult. So to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment. For example you have just been yourself and you making all that you want, a lot of people they not want to like that so they want to try to make you fall, so if you have been in a world that is constantly trying to make you else is always want to be the greatest accomplishment. If you are in a world that people like you only for been yourself it is good because you have just been yourself you can make anything happen and if you have a world that is constantly trying to make something else is the best accomplishment because everything is want to be easier for you sometimes you have to choose decision and I think just been yourself you always can take the right ones
