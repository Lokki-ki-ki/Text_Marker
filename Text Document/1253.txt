Agree you will never grow if something beyond of what you have mastered. However, some people believe that you don't have to do this to grow that you can grow conform the time. Emerson's was right with this quote people have thought more than just of what they believe, if they grow they will achieve their dreams if they achieve they will grow you just have to believe in what you are. Unless you try to do something respect, you have to do the best of you if you want to grow. Base in my experiences I'm growing, I try hard, and I try to convince the other do to the same, we want a better world we students to grow if they grow this will be a proud for the others. If we don't an open mind this will be the opposite we will never grow, no matter what is happening he have to grow. At the end of all of this we will have something do where we can be support our live, always come something better, you have to be organized with your things. The idea is to be your self don't ever let other people to control you just be you, and the decision is on you. Don't you ever be an position to where you have to decide between to options? That's when you to believe in yourself, to thing want your want to be grown or stay in the floor. If you grow will be more opportunities for you and maybe don't just for you can be for the others who are around of you. Give the best of you to make it, for example if you don't try to grow what will be of you what kind of person you will be. There are benefits to grow like you can be a person who can do almost all the things, you can be accepted or be sociable. Emerson gave us a great point with this statement we have to appreciate of what he wrote in my view he complete right about to try something beyond what you have already, just try, and you can make it.
