Online classes, I think that if students really trying to learn something is not needed for them to take classes online but sometimes, teachers cannot teach all the students well because is only 1 teacher and like 30 students in every classroom, and I think that online classes are not a bad idea because they have been taught by a computer, and they have to pay attention, or they will fail, but at school they won't fail that easy because they can get copy from another students and that's how they will pass classes better at school then online. Now let's really talk about online classes, is a perfect solution for students that for some reason they can't go to school in case that they had a car accident they can't walk, but they parent don't want them to fail the school year, or they don't feel like going to school that's why online classes are the best choice not only for me for a lot of people like student and parents; I mean school is not that bad at school students can make more and more friends every year online they will get tired if they have to see the same computer and hear the same voice every day.
