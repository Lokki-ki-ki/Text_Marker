Would you like to have more school?. I will be writing about weather, I would like more school or not. I disagree because some, kids don't get enough sleep. I disagree because some, kids don't get enough sleep. Some kids stay up, late because of electronics, helping someone, or watching TV. some kids have to help their parents, do some work like farmers or cooking. Some kids lose, track of time like me. Some kids have afternoon activities. Some kids are tired of school but if they make, its longer kids would be even more tired. It would give, students less time to take breaks at home. Grades would get worst because, the students get less time to take a break. Some kids would get home really late. The school buses sometimes, take an hour to drop of a kid but if they add an hour and a half those, kids would get home peaty late. Some kids won't have enough time to do their homework, because they are going to get home late. Some kids would not have time to do stuff because after getting of the bus late some, kids have to help around the house or their parents when they get back. Some kids will not have a lot of time to see parents of friends. Some kids get out late because of bus or after school activities, and they will not, have a lot of time left. Some kids will bot have a lot of time to get out, because of school, and they will need to do their homework. In conclusion, I disagree with the prompt because, I don't want to have a lot of school in a single day.
