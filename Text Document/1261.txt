If you alone in the world you can make nothing if you're trying to make something you can't because somebody support to you, you can't associate with the technology, and you can dessarollate nothing maybe just you can survive and after then you dead, I think I'm agree with Emerson's Wrote, because when you can make all you want individuality I think you can be better because you don't need help to other person or something, so all your responsibilities is with you, when you need to help to the other person sometimes everything to be fine and sometimes no, because sometimes your plans about you want to do or about you thinking is not really well like about you imaginary to do, the imagination is other thinks, you can imaginary all you want but in reality all your imagination is not the same because you can imagined much thinks but in the real life you can't make all your imagination about you want is like impossible doing all your imagination perfect, so my conclusion is we can live alone in the world, but you need support to the people too because the same time all the world desolate, and the same time we destroy the world because we make much contamination, deforetation, we create many machines ruin the world, change climate. I think the author waldo Emerson wrote he references about like what you're doing alone in one world if you care the world o destroy the world if u can alone or need to support the people.
