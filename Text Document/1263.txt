Self-esteem doesn't come from praise or achievement, In my opinion both of those are only "supporters" to recognize the person effort, all of about self steam really comes from ourselves, our thoughts, ideas and efforts we've done. Self-esteem is what to make you be, what you transmit, act or just to look like, that's why is really important to have that present because everyone should have self-esteem. Some people believe in praising a student's to build self-esteem, even if the work is not the student's best effort, also so meany people believe that praise given for deficient work undermines learning by lowering standard, I agree with this one because as humans we are, while more people are praising us, we just will start to act maybe wrongly because is too much attention. Teachers might support students to get better as people also keep getting motivated while they're doing a test or classwork, sometimes with words to make them feel they are doing a great job, but they shouldn't do that every day because not everyone notices the value those actions has. First, If for example there were 3 students who are very lazy, but they start to do better things, the teacher will probably praise them because they made an "effort" but if teachers start to do that every time, students could act as lack of attention even if they don't, and there is the problem, of course students must be more confident in order to learn when they are making some efforts to do their work, however some of them just take advantage of that, when they just think because they have good grades they should to get an achievement or praises from others, even if they don't. In addition, If in our own homes parents do teach us what's to have a good self-lesteem and how we have to be, we'll not need the approbation your opinion from other people, and it will be enough because we'd already know how to act like, and just to think that we need an achievement or praising from someone to prove we're good on something, it's completely wrong, you don't have to get an achievement to prove you're good on something you like it or enjoy doing. The only thing we have to do is always make an effort, just prove to yourself you are good on something because you want to, not because you're waiting for an action from a person, also not every time you have to get some time to prove you are doing a good job bc you are not always to do a good job, because nobody is perfect and everyone has a lot of mistakes, just do it for yourself. Not always everything is going to be super easy in life to us, sometimes you have to go through several situations that will make you grow as a person, every human've had self-esteem issues at least once and that's alright. I think we shouldn't depend on an opinion to get better each day for ourselves, we've to notice we are not perfect, we have mistakes and not everyone will always be cheering up us, we have to fail once or more and then just get up and keep going, with our skills and mistakes also knowing that not always we have to get something to prove our knowledge, that's where self-esteem comes from.
