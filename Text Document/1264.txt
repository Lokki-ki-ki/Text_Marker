Is enjoyable for everyone because you can do all sort of fun activities. One way I like spending my time is playing soccer with all my friends we gather around to play every day almost and some time we like to do competition in group seven to play who get the most goals, and then we let the girls play when we finish playing girls, and then we compare and the teams with more goal wins a prize same for the girls who are better of course we another match with the boy to double the prize then the match start for the boys for about hours is lot entertaining and fun you sweat, laugh, tell scary tails when the night comes we all get creep out at some point. When we finish, we do a picnic to get our energy back and drink a lot of water to keep hydrated and while we prepared the food we play some short game to gain more appetite first we play limbo to stretch the body then is dash ball to burn calories last is baseball to stretch the muscle, and then we take a break to eat and play even more its help you a lot to maintain your physical health if you go to the park three days a week that's why I love the park so much it helps me a lot to get relax. It helps you with your health that why I don't go to the doctor to much is joyful to me when I go to the park.
