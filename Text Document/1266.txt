Thomas Jefferson wrote a letter to determine never to be idle. It's one of the most important things that happen in the world, One of this was with young people, they be disrespectful with olds people. At this point I think everyone is agreed with the statement of Thomas Jefferson. For example, That is one of the problem that happen on many schools cause let's say when teacher tried to explain us something about the intimate section they star to Idle when this is no funny. Also, Thomas Jefferson inspire people to help others when they are idle to an innocent people. Additionaly we can stop the kind of problem if we work together helping each other. It's wonderful if people work as a community and tried to help other, cause Thomas Jefferson was a man who like to help people on what he can. When someone else was Idle to you don't put attention and keep fighting on what you want. Like everyone know we have different talent and always one person of them was jealousy and tried to Idle you because he doesn't want you or someone else progresses more them he that unfair everyone has different dreams and work hard for what they want. On my opinion we can work as a group and tried to stop those people who Idle others. Also, we can do something else cause let's said if someone Idle others and we boon't help these guys the problem continued and repeat CUADI anyone work with the kind of problem. Something else was some people don't like to help others. That cause that kind of problem but we as a community we can work on that and tried to stopped.
