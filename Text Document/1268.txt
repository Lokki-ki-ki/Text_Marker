In my experiences be disagreed with this statement because everybody have different personalities, The person have one day bad, and the persona change. However the first impressions can be change, Everybody has different personalities because the people make much characters they see different for example a person can have much collided that other people don't have, Also do not always other person have that be yourself. The person have one day bad because something the people in the school can have stressful for example when have so much homework during in class, also the person in the job is possible that have problem for example the other person can cause conflict and making is mad.However, the people change because they can have a good expression of a manner that your attitude can be splendid, for example no every person have bad comportment. In conclusion every one can be different personalities and not is impossible change our impressions have that be we yourself.
