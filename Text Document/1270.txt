I think I agree on the Churchill statement because :every time you failure more and more, every time you learn something new, for example :my mom always puts me to clean the house but every time I went to do the cleaning, she used to say "you didn't clean here or "you are missing a part of the floor that still is dirty" so I just say to my self next time I'm going to clean better in this part of the room and I keep smiling not given up. To learn how to clean the house in a perfect way I decided to clean the house every Saturday so I can practice more, it passed two months and then I went to clean again and I mop the floor, clean the windows, clean all the tables, so I finished, and my mom says great job you now know how to clean in a perfect way!!.remember to success you don't even have to think about what you do wrong just keep working on it, and keep dreaming!!!
