Students should graduate in three years instead of four years. It is better for students to graduate in three years because students will finish the career that they choose early, and they will be able tho help their families. The first reason is that students will finish the career that they choose early. Students will have 1 years less to graduate. For example, a student is planning to graduate in 2021 and start his career to finish it in 2026 but now that students will be allowed to graduate 1 year early then the student will finish his career in 2025. It means that the students will reach their goals early. Students can reach a better life in less time working hard with positive mind. The second reason is that students will be able to help their families. One year less make the difference. For example, a student's mother is really sick, and the student have a part-time job, but he doesn't gain enough money to buy his mother medicines, and he has to graduate, but he is still in his third year of high school, so he has one more year but now that he can graduate in three years he can receive his diploma and find a full job time to gain enough money to help his mother. It means that one year less can help you change the life of your family to better. One year less can bring chances for others. Some people believe that students should not graduate in three years instead of four years. However, others including me believe that students should be allowed to graduate in three years because students will finish the career that they choose early, and they will be able to help their families.
