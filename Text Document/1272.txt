When you are a kid your parents tell you what your character is had to be they teaching you how you have to be they intend to help you to be a better person, for example they tell you what is wrong and what not, what you can do and what you can't do. But when you are a big person you can choose whoever your character is going to be, for example you choose what is wrong and what is good for you because you are big now, and you can do your own decision. You're able to thing and get the responsibilities to choose your own character, and you are agreed if you make a mistake you're going to take the consequences, because your choose to be like that. So is not beyond our control because you think how you want to be for your life for the things you are learned before in the past and that is the things the changing you. Is nothing out of control because you can choose your character, Examples if there's a man who needs help you can choose to be a good person and help him or just let him there and that's make you a bad person and when you need help nobody is going to help you. The character is important in a person because the character make you who you are that's why you have the power to choose what your character is going to be you CNA choose how you want to be a good person or bad person and that's the person you want to be. And your character is what make you the person you are, and the people is gonna say that you are a good person or not depend on what your character choose and that's it the character it was make a person. So that's what I said, I said we choose our own character traits.
