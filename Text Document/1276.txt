Do curfews keep teenagers out of trouble, or do they unfairly interfere young people's lives? In my opinion yes curfews have to take care of them, it does matter if they are young, Also if they are in the night. This is a good intention from curfews, to protect them at the end the only beneficiaries are the teenagers. For example if they are in the middle of the night they can get trouble, because they're going to do wherever they want when nobody is watching them, for other part if curfews say not they have to respect the rules.Otherwise, nobody is in the street playing or doing something good in the night, all people are in home resting or with their family doing other things, they have to apply the same for teenagers. Also in the night someone can steal your properties, or doing something bad to someone or to you, why? To you because maybe you are watch what others are doing to someone, and you try to help or do something. Some people thing that have fun in the night is good idea. But is not, for examples going to the clubs is not good in my opinion, because you don't anybody, or something can happen, for example in Las Vegas almost 3 years ago someone shooting a club in the middle of the night many people die. In conclusion curfews have to take care of the teenagers this is good for them.
