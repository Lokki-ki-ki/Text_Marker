It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change. This statement is false because you can't judge a person based on their appearance because sometimes people are just having a bad day and when you become friends with them, you find out how that person actually is. For example, you meet a person that has a lot of tattoos, and you have a bad impression of them, but then, you interact with that person, and you find out that he/she is not what you thought; therefore you can't judge a person based on their appearance. I think that how a person dresses doesn't determine the type of person someone is, but if you let someone express their feelings your opinion on them will completely change. In addition, when you become friends with someone, and you talk with them, sometimes they tell you that when you met them, they weren't having a good day. Also, what a lot of people don't understand is that everyone have problems, and they don't know what other people are passing through. Sometimes you have a bad impression of someone because of what other people say and the opinion you have on them do not change until you start talking to that person, I think that this an error that a lot of us make, we judge a person without knowing how they actually are. For example, once I had a friend that talked awful about a girl and I believed everything he said, but when I started talking to her, she was completely different from what this one friend had told me about her. In conclusion, people are not always what they seem to be, and you can't judge them on how they look. I think everyone should first try to get along with someone and then, they can judge. That's why I think that you can change first impressions.
