I think it is a good idea because students might be tired of working at school every day. Let's say that students want this the same school schedule that has a longer winter break, a year-round school, and a week off in the spring and fall because people want more time to do spend time with family, do homework, projects etc... First, We can spend time with family and friends, we can watch a movie with them, eat food together as a family, have parties and celebrate at our house. We need families to stay together as a group because if we don't then we are going to miss them too much as we go to college or get our new place to live. Nobody wants to stay alone because if they want to stay alone that's okay if you want. Second, We can go on a vacation to the beach, the pool, Disney world etc... I love going to the pool in the summer because we don't have to stay at our house all day and all night. There is so much to do outside then just staying inside and doing nothing. We must stay with our family because they love you so much, and they want to spend time with you too. Finally, We can relax from work and studying we are tired of working so hard that we need a break. We are studying so hard for school, we did lots of tests and quizzes that we are tired from. We all enjoy summer vacation because we can spend time with our family and friends, we can invite our friends to eat, go to mall, watch a movie etc... In conclusion, We must spend time with family and friends to go anywhere in the world for a vacation. We can enjoy each other by going to an amusement park or a museum to play and take pictures to save it on our phone for memories. We need to be together as a family, work as a team, having fun on a vacation. People might think that their family is annoying, or they don't love them but your parents and siblings love you because we are not perfect in every way.
