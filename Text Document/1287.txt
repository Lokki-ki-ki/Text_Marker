I understand the company Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote," Unless you try to so something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow. Base on your experience, I think is a good idea from Ralph Waldo because he is trying to convince us if we do not think before doing anything we will never grow. Is it important to know if we do not think before doing anything we will never grow. For example, if we want to invest our money in something that is very expensive, and we do not have a lot of money to pay it, but we insist on investing in that we are not going to get ahead. Another example is, when is almost time to pay bills we have to save money to pay them. Because he is trying to convince us if we do not think before doing anything we will never grow. I think is a good idea from Ralph Waldo. Thank you for considering my ideas regarding.
