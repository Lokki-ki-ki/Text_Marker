Once author Ralph Waldo Emerson Said "unless you try to do something beyond what you have master you will never grow", and he is right. To truly understand what the author is trying to be saying you must understand that to say that you have mastered something is to be able to do it without failed. In order to grow you must set goals for your self. Even if those steps that you take are small they help you walk the path of achieving greater things. Not everything comes easy it may take years to master or even learn, but with the right amount of confidence and self confidence you can reach mastery. If you can ride a bike than learn how to ride a mottercicel, if you are able to make a cupcake than learn how to bake a cake, if you know how to float then learn and teach your self how to swim. Small tasks like these can help you improve skills that you already know and have. By improving those skills you can reach higher places and do bigger things. Until you push your self you will never reach the goals you set but with the right amount of dedication you can reach your goals and move beyond what you already know. Just because you can't do one small task doesn't mean that you can not master it you have to keep trying and trying till you can master it but until then you will never grow. Now it's up to you to decide weather or not you want to grow as a person or not weather to grow or stay the same and never to active your goals in life.
