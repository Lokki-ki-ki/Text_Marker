Being yourself in a world that wants you to be something else is a great feeling, but it takes time to be happy for an example, your parents want you to be a doctor or a lawyer, but you want to be a rapper or dancer, but you don't know how to tell them because you think they would be disappointed. Would you want to make your parents to feel disappointedâ€™ll give another example people who like the same sex, theirs been so many stories an article of people dying because their expressing themselves a lot of people are scared, so they don't tell anyone, so they become depressed they use a lot of drugs to lose the pain but nothing ever works. In my opinion I agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson it's an amazing feeling to be yourself and not follow other people because at the end of the day you need to be doing things that make you happy not for other, your priories come first be who ever you want to be like and who ever you want you live one life.
