Take learning distance on home is not good ideas. First reason is not the same to take on school. When we're going schools we have more option to learning. Sometime when we don't understand something we can ask the teacher for helping, or they can explain many times. But sometimes we have to take the classes on home. For example if you are sick or have a specific reason that you can go schools is necessary take online because if we what to learn is the matter we have to take the classes. The important thing is that we have the energy to continues with your goals. The Learning distance on home some time be helping to be more positive and focus because we can take the class any hours we can. Also, when we cut the class on home we have more chance to listening. The other option to take the class on home is that we can do other things that we what. Some schools give the chance to often the class on home that is great ideas. But is sometimes really important to going schools because when we're going schools we have more chance to take more class and graduated with the other student. Also take class for video conferencing or going school is little similar because we can see the teacher that is explained the class. That unique things is we can not ask the teacher for helping. In conclusion. To be attended on schools is more important and helping more that the distance learning or video conferencing. On my position attend on schools is more necessary because we have more opportunity to learn and continues to do the things that we what.
