The British john Lubbock wrote 'your character will be what you yourself choose to make it'there for is a bit concerning about how kids change there characters just because they don't fell good about themselves and have a lot of thinking inside them the traits that you carry will have a dominance over them but i don't think that its best answering the question there for do actually they take control beyond our control. There for it will be not always the case between how other view your things and traits makes you in insecure how other people see you, and you change to make your self better than our parents gave us something we just got it from society like there is a lot of influences in the internet and more things that can go far behind the imaginable, and they are not controlled by anyone they are just more likely to have more influences beyond there control, but there are a lot of influences in this world you just got to find the right one for you and stick with it general likely there is more change in society for different perspectives. Secondly there is a possible outcome that you everyone can get out of this, just like other people that change there perspective at looking at things there for I should say that I have changed a lot since I got here in Virginia and am I adapting to being normal well the normal way of being normal for other people there are influences beyond our control because what you see on the internet you will want to mimic it one day like there is a lot of rapers talking about 'girls, god there is an it of are influences in our daily lives always hearing what a rapper did or what type of things he is going to do there for it's a bit concerning about all that because for a person that just moved here is a lot of change there is a lot of people that influence almost all the world in California there is where I lived all the artist and musical players and all of them have a purpose of having more people being influenced by them and making a lot of money if they get a lot of attention from a lot of people.There are kids just like adults that get influence by others there is a possibility that we choose our own ideas of being influenced that are out of our control we choose to be this way we choose our path always they follow what we want there for I am proud of the world we live in. There is a possibility that new things come out every year new things that 'kill' us or maybe other things like war and most of the things happening to our world and more solution and more virus that want to kill us, and it is being more influenced by others to be scared of it because you could die from that there is a lot of thinking behind every smart influences. Have a nice day, that is what makes us movie forward every time that we get stuck.
