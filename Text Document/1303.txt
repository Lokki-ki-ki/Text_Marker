In cartoon sponge bob square pants sponge bob he says" imagination" as to us is inferring for us to use our imagination, like no matter how old you are what disabilities you have is inferring to everyone, But do you ever think imagination is important than knowledge? Beginning, with this statement I agree because, when we were young little kids we would always imagine that was our big thing like, as another parent would probably say to your child" your child has a big imagination ". And imagination will always be a part of us we grew up having our little or big imagination's how do you think we would imagine us in the future or like some other examples: how we want to wear out clothes, what type of clothes we wanna wear, what design we want on our cake, or and how we imagine unicorns, ninjas, or any of those type of things, and superheros. Without imagination, we wouldn't know about that or the sense of knowing what that is. Also, having imagination is also good because were not always going to use our knowledge like for disable people not all of them have knowledge or even know what that is, for one example blind people yeah they have knowledge but also in there life they use there imagination throughout a blind person's life imagination is something they will use in there life spam and you want to know why how do you think blind people know what a teacher is talking about or how they are drawing it blind people use there imagination they use it, so they can understand what the teacher is doing or when they are walking down the street or when buying clothes, There number one thing there gonna always use is imagination knowledge might also help because you have some information about it or do they just magically know what there doing no they imagine it, or they imagine were this thing is or that thing. In conclusion, I agree with this statement" imagination is more important than knowledge" because for those given reasons like the one about us as kids we would use our imagination and how we would use it for ourselves and the other given example for the blind people how they have that throughout there life spam. Therefore those are my reasons I agree with the given statement.
