Have you ever thought of a place in the world you would like to visit? Some people would go to France to see the popular Eiffel Tower; while others would go to Hawaii just to relax. For me however, I would like to visit Generic_City because the people there are well-mannered and kind. And also because there are amazing waterfalls and parks. To begin with, the people there are well-mannered and kind because they treat each other like brothers and sisters instead of mortal enemies. And something I would like to do once I arrive, is to greet these grateful and thankful people because they are gentle to one another. Furthermore, most of the people in Dubai make an honest living and there is rarely any crimes caused by residents. Additionally, there are amazing waterfalls and parks because the designs and structures are well-made and created. For instance, when visiting the waterfalls at night, it is very colorful which makes it beautiful to watch. Also, something I would like to do when I arrive, is to go on a boat ride because it is very peaceful, and it makes you feel calm as the ride goes along. In conclusion, a place in the world I would like to visit is Generic_City because the people there are well-disciplined and nice. And Also because there are outstanding waterfalls and parks.
