A problem is a chance for you to do your best. I agree with this statement because of many reasons, first reason why I agree is it will never solve the problem if you don't try to at least do it, second reason is that you feel more competitive to face the problem, the last reason is that your friends and family can help you a lot with the problem. If there is a problem going on with your life you should always try to solve that, and do your best to solve it. If you don't do anything about the problem it is going to effect your life even more. So you might as will do all you can to do something good that can solve the problem. For example someone comes and bullies you every day, and if you don't do anything about that then it's going to get worse and worse every day. When you see a problem getting in your way of accomplishing your goals, you should always stand up for your self and face the problem, and beat the problem, so it can never bother you again. There are many you have to face during your life for example, if there is a that always bothers you or bullies you, you should do something about it. If you had a problem face you there probably someone that helped you a little to solve it. It's always really important to tell a friend or a family what's going on in your life because it always makes you feel better. The reason why it makes you feel better is that when you're saying all the problems to your family or friend they kinda have ideas how you can solve it. For example if a bully starts to beat you up then the only people that can help you is family and friends. A problem is a chance for you to do your best. This statement is a perfect statement because it really motivates people to face there problems, and get them out of there way. I agreed to this statement because of all the reasons I was talking about in the other paragraphs.
