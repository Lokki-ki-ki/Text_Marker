Technology is good for much stuff. For example, technology is good for research, homework or other stuff. But, they there is a negative effect on people's lives. Technology can be use for bad stuff like in internet, researching bad stuff on the website. But like I said technology is good for many stuffTechnology is good for research because when you're doing a project or study for test. But you don't know anything you just research on the website. Also, good for your homework, you can find the answer or get information rewrite on your word. But, technology has negative effects on people's lives.(I was talking a computer). Technology is good for play game. For example, I have a PlayStation Four and so many video games. I play all day not get bored. But then, much too technology can cost your eye to get hurt or lose your eyesight. There an other thing is bad for us as a teen. We waste so much time on video game rather spend time on doing our homework, prove writing skill, reading. Technology (phone) is good for communication with other people in fairy away places. For example, My family live in Generic_City, but my aunt and uncle live in Generic_City. But we use a phone to call them if their fine, and we talk them about our life. Even tho were far away them we still communicate with them.
