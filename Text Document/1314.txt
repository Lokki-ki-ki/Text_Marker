One place I would like to go visit in this world would be portico because it looks like a wonderful place to live in and because I want to experience how it is to live there or how school is for them. It might be a life changing for me to see how they live there maybe I might start being grateful for what I have and they don't and I would start helping others for often. One reason I would go to portico is to see how they do stuff different like what they wear, what they eat, and what they do on day it would be interesting seeing all that and I would like to try new food and wear the cloths they wear and try to see how it feels to be a Podgorica. Another reason I would love to go to portico is because at the USA I am not grateful for what I have and maybe if is I go over to portico I will be grateful for what I have because I will see the difference of how I live and how they live it will also melt my heart to see them eating unhealthy and I am over here throwing my food away because i don't want it. My final reason for wanting to go to portico is because I will want to see how their parents are with the kids like when they get in trouble. I also want to see how teachers are with their students when they get in trouble because I want to see if they are different from El Salvador cause there they hit their students with the ruler and that is not okay. In conclusion I would like to see every difference they have from the USA and El Salvador and I want to try every food that they have and spend time with students. I want to be grateful of everything that I am able to have and they don't and maybe share the stuff that I have and they don't. Now I really want to go to portico and explore new stuff and have a nice adventure.
