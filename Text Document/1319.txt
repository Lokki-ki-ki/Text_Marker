Do you think that high school should only be 3 years instead of 4 years? Well some might say it would be better having 3 years of school other than 4 years. But the way to achieve it is difficult. I think that school should be only 3 years. Beacause some students don't really want to be in school for too long. This can give student's a goal so that they don't have to stay for 4 years. It would give the students a higher chance to focus on school and then head out to college for those who are interested.I believe that if student's can find a goal of having to be going for 3 years in school instead of 4 years. It would take them hard work and confident in order to earn it, but other's might say that they prefer to be in school longer. Because of friend's or liking to learn a lot and it no rush toward them for they are inserted in learning. But in the future I hope that Eva student can find a way to be successful in there time in school.
