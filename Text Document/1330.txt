On my experiences I think It would be impossible to change the first impressions because one different people have different types of characteristics traits. For example one of my friend who move to text, her characteristic traits I remember she was so nice to everybody when she used to live her in Virginia, and also she used to get along with everybody at the school. This shows that type of impressions that my friend Generic_Name has. Another example is when I was in lunch line with my friend Generic_Name, a Spanish girl touch my hair, I did not know that girl was the girlfriend of the boy that was in one of my class. Until then when I was going to my third class I ask that boy if he could help me find this class because I did not know where all my classes were, when he came up to me to explain the schedule and told me and him had the same class, his girlfriend look at me mad. This shows that at first the girl of the boy was nice and then the girl of the boy was kind of mean to mean. Last example everybody has different types of impressions, it could be in a good way or bad way. Sometimes people impressions might change, or they might still be the same.
