Changing our school men to much healthier choice's is a good idea because it's good for the students to eat much healthier food in school. Eating more fresh fruits and water can help students focus and not fall asleep in class. Eating junk food could make you tired, and you won't have the energy to do anything. It's better to take away the opinion of getting junk food that the cafeteria puts out for students. Students won't be so tempted to eat it, and could choose a better and healthier choice. Most students want to stay in shape, so they try to eat healthier. Adding healthier choices in TH school cafeteria men could help them stay in shape. Most students don't work out, so they depend on the food they eat. Some students tend to buy food and then throw it out because of how the food is made. The school could make a scald bar for those who chose to eat it, and they could add their own toppings, so they could eat something they like instead of throwing it out. I think having fruits smoothies, organic bake goods, and a salad bar could be very good for every school to have because the school could make a lot of money selling this at school and it's healthy for students to eat and enjoy. Most students won't have to get Uber eats to get food that they like if the school sold smoothies or bake goods. And staff members that get lunch from the cafeteria could enjoy having a healthier lunch.in conclusion changing the schools cafeterias men to much healthier choice would be good for students and staff members, so they could stay healthy and focus.
