When you need advice do you just talk to one person or more? It's way better telling people the things that happen, so you can get there view because you might not see it the way they do. When you tell more people you get more advice and that's good. Let's say that you have some things going on in your life, and you want some advice to try to make it a bit better, so you ask a couple of your friends to help you and give you some advice. They give you advice, and you take it and try it, and it works, so it made you feel it better but that's only one advice they gave from all your friends, so there is still a bit more. So you day got better. And yes I sometimes understand you don't want to share your stuff with people, so you just have one friend you tell everything to, and they help with everything they listen, give back what they think. A yea you might have a different thought of if this like you might think just telling one person is better because you don't feel like sharing your stuff with people and I get that but when you need advice do you just want that person or a lot of people giving you advice. It's your choice on what pick. But I still asking people for some advice is better because like I said earlier they give more advice, They will give there option and tell if is you're in the right or wrong. And they will always be there for you no matter what, that's why I say yes. Because you never know what they will tell you or do about the things you tell them but if their real friends they'll stick by you side no matter what.
