I believe that gaining life experience and learning from your mistakes and working hard, comes when we are always doing something and accomplish more. Accomplish more and always doing something is important to me because it gives me more opportunity to be successful in life. To begin with, by practicing playing my favorite sport, soccer every day after school and on my free time; because I was in my school team, and I was awful and weak at it. Practicing helped me to overcome my weakness and to learn from my mistakes, and also to know the rules of the game and basis of soccer. Some people believe inactivity serve a purpose that led you to success;however, we gain life experience and learning from our mistakes if we are always doing something, or we accomplished more. Also, by practicing soccer every day and working hard on it, I learned tricks and how to kick the ball directly to my teammates and how to be good goalkeeper and catch the ball as well. And that gives me more experience and strength to continue. Another example, one day we were playing and there was judgments there, choosing the best player to be in the "International Soccer Team", depending on how the player plays and how they follow the rules. Three days later, I got nominated to participate in the International team and I also got honored for being the best player in the game and of course, that led me to successful opportunity in the future.
