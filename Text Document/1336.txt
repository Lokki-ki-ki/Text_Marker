Should people make their own decision, or should they seek guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matters ? Some people value self-reliance and feel the need to follow their own instincts and ideas. Although these people are confident and trust themselves, I believe people should ask for advice from their parents and other professionals before making important life decisions.First, most people respect and value their parents. For example, when I consider getting another job, I like to discuss my options with my parents. They help me look at both the good and bad things about different job. They bring up things that I may have not thought about. Their advice help me make better decisions. I appreciate their knowledge because they know me very well and want the best for me. Therefor, I think It' is important to ask for their guidance in these matters. Secondly, I would ask not only my family, not also my teachers when I make decisions about my education. For instance, after I graduate from high school and earn my diploma I will ask my teacher about the possibility of going to a community college or taking extra classes to help me get a good job that will make me happy and provide me with skills make so that I can live a better life. My teacher have worked hard with me to provide me with guidance and the skills I need to be smart in life. Thatswhy, I think people should ask for help and guidance from their parents and teacher before making important life decisions. Both my parents and my teachers know my strengths and weaknesses and can help me in making the best decisions.
