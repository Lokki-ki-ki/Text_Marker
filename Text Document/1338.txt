I think that several people make their own decision's then other people about there life because" they might need help on what to do?"for the people that need guidance to know more info.I believe that the people that found a way of making their own decision were so confidence that they had to decided on what to do. But if they don't, it would be wise to ask for assistance to make decision with experts so that way they can have in idea of what decision to make. Because if they had made their own decision that they had regret that would have been there issue for not making a wise chose. But anyway people who are confidence can make their own choices. Other however the ones that need assistant might not know what to do when they have a decision to make. Those people ask for help. They ask for guidance so that they can have more of an idea of what they are going to decide which gives them a higher opportunity to decide which could led up to a good or bad situation. It all depends on the person who is determent to decide.I suggest that both ways all depend on a person because we all have our different way's and many can cause a huge impact on people life the more info you know the better you have to understand what path you are taking because new's had speed that people are making wrong decision which led to be endanger. Some say that making your own decision is your issue while some ask for assistant to know what to do in a situation. Which can be good for several people around the world.
