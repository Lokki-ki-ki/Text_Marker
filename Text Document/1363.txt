I disagree because students don't only like sport or making year books and student council students also want to try other things like art, music, computers. Students like other things not all students like the same things. There are other things to try out extracurricular activities. I think the principal should think about other extracurricular activities. Like other schools don't have only 3 extracurricular activities there are other extracurricular activities to think of like I said theirs art, music, cooking, chess club, drama, computer, science, math, reading, writing, anything else not only sports making year books or student council if they repeat all 3 extracurricular activities that dumb boring maybe some students may agree with these decisions some student will not agree because not all students share the same personality or have something in common and some students like sports some don't some students don't like making year books some students don't like student counseling. In my personal opinion art is an activity I want. There are many extracurricular activities I want to do I would do art reading and drama because I love to draw I love to read Marvel Comics especially Dr. Strange Spider-man Guardians of the Galaxy and black panther I love drama because I am going to be an actor, and a director when I grow up, and I know a lot of students don't only want to do sports making year book or student council students love other things. I know a lot of students and people opinion. If you must participate in one of these extracurricular activities well everybody will think schools boring, but the thing is it's the principal decision and chose if he or she wants all the students to participate in at least all 3 extracurricular activity then you really have no chose, but anyone can still disagree on all extracurricular activities maybe you can ask the principal if you don't want to do any of the activities.
