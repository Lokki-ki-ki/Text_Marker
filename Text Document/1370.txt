I totally agree that is important to have a positive attitude to success in life. Having a good attitude can help people to get a job. For example, if there are two guys on a job interview and one of them show a positive attitude while are asking him questions but, the other person is answer all the question with a bad attitude, the person with a positive attitude will get the job because, a good attitude show who you really are. Showing a positive attitude can really show where you came from and how your parents educate you. Otherwise, if a person show a bad attitude, and he is insulting all the people and his way that demonstrate that his parents didn't give him a nice education. Because, the attitude came from how your family had taught you to respect the people. A nice attitude can even help in the education. In other way attitude is the most important key in education because, nobody will teach someone with a bad education. It is important to demonstrate a positive attitude when a teacher is explaining something because, that way you demonstrate the teacher how much effort you are putting in the education and that you really want to success in your life. Other people thing that is not important to have a good attitude to success in life. Because, sometime you can be in a bad moon and attitude is something that you can't control. So, attitude is something is something that can you hold. In conclusion, having a positive attitude can help you reach your goals because a good attitude demonstrate personality, education, and how careful you are with other people. Having a positive attitude can tell how your parents growth you up and how you really care to learn a high education.
