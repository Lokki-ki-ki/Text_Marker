" In this world you decide who do want to be either you get along with it or someone teaches you" although some people think that our character formed by influences beyond our control nevertheless we choose our character traits people on your environment and also people who you talk to I believe that the one that influence me is that we choose our own charactersFirst People on your environment influence a lot because in front of them you decide who you want to be, and you choose your traits so I think that you choose your traits on the type of environment that you are on you are living for Example My brother Generic_Name when he was around me, he was a different person we talked like brother help each other as brothers when he was around Dad And mom he was another type of person he was not the same with me, he was kinder but when we were on school he another type of person he was mean He didn't care about me and other people he wouldn't treat me he changed his traits to a whole different level That proves that a person can change their traits depends on the environment that they are growing. Second people who we talked too we eventually we change our way to be to different people the way that we talk to our people are a different person when u talk to your relatives friends cousins brothers we eventually changed the way to be for example one day A guy named Generic_Name received a call from his parents saying Generic_Name it's time to come home And Generic_Name respectfully said Te's mom I will go home right Away after he finishes his call he talked to us saying Dude I need to leave but like right now!! Screming that proves that we change the way that act with different people or the way that we talk with different types of people.to conclude we choose our character traits because we talk and people around we choose how we act around people who we talk to are the ones that affect us more because that's the one that we do on daily bases the other one people on your environment is the way that u want to be looked by different type of people around your self.
