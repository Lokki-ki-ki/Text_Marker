Dear TEACHER_NAMETEACHER_NAME I agree of community service because I'm done it before. It's not bad, and it doesn't take anything of my time. I had to do 120 hours of community service. At first I thought it would be boring but a few days later it was fun. I had to do 120 because me and other friends did trespass at SCHOOL_NAME. It kinda sucks because I had to go to court and my mom and dad were mad because they had to pay 200 dollars for the ticket. That wasn't cool!! Well the next day I went that same school, and they told me that I couldn't be there at all! And they also said that if they see me there at that same school they would call the police on me again. That's why you shouldn't drive fast or pass red lights because they would double the money. Now i Noe not to go to that school again. But once in while I go there to say hi to the principle and the teachers I had when I was in 6 grade and when I was in 5 grade those were my best teacher ever.
