You will never grow into something you want to be in the future if you don't find your inner indite. Once you've found it, you could do all sorts of things and find what's best for you. Some people have great talents, some have bad ones, but they have one thing in common is that they practice really hard to master them. No matter what they say, don't let it get in your head just focus on getting to master your talent first. Practice makes everything perfect even if you found something new, and you want to try it out. The first time you won't get it so easily like you thought you would, but though lots of practice you will get it right in no time and better at it to. An example of this is if you're riding a bike, you fall down, but through practice you'll be riding your bike without falling off of it anymore. We were all born with some talent that we don't know of, we just got to figure out what it is. If you found something you're perfect at, then stick with at all times, and never let that talent slip away. If it does then you will be forgetting everything, and the talent you once had, and you'll have to find a new one. Based on your experiences try to find something different but a little simmer. For example, if you worked at fast food restaurant you might want to work at a store next time. They have one thing in common is money. Whether having a talent or just practicing, know that you're having fun whether you hate it or love it, and not for very long you will master it in no time. If you have done some of these, then you are ready to master a new talent. Different things can have an impact in your life, but that's how we all stated from very beginning; we have never known we had a special talent until we try something new.
