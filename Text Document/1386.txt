Should a student work be praised no matter how bad it is? This sounds like a good idea in theory, but when you think of it only in the educational field is really a terrible thing to do. As people; We all want to be praised for how we work, and we can only get better if we practice something over and over and over again and can get even more if we're happy with what we're practicing and happiness comes with every praise. But if all we got while learning was praise but nothing to improve on then what would be the point to continue learning if all we get is a "this is amazing" or an A+ on every assignment they got. They would improve, but students also develop zero tolerance to any criticism and probably going to want all the attention focused at them. A great example to this would be any artist; artists are based all around the idea of everything they make are things that they'll hate even if there's true improvement. They get praised but that's not what drives them to do better it's the hatred of what they do that gives the motivation to improve and even take criticism with a grain of salt but use it to get better. Using what we learned from any artist it'd be a terrible thing to do, as the purpose of a student is to learn and use what they learned in the world and in the world there's going to be people who criticize what they do and if they can't take that criticism they're most likely going to get fired. In conclusion. I'm not saying that praising too much is a bad thing and i'm also not saying you should make the student hate what they're doing. But I am saying that with every praise should be a criticism just to balance it out and show the students that with every positive comes a negative and that the worlds not just going to be all praise to a person.
