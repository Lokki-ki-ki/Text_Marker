I think it does keep them out of trouble it protects them. When teenagers are out in the street it's could be because they are doing something bad you never know what they could be doing after 10pm or midnight. I never hang out by myself at that hour unless I'm with my parents or at a family party, there is no point to be out late at night but many people don't care and be out late at night many teenagers don't obey the laws.It's important to have curfews, it keeps teenager from being out at night. In the weekend teenagers may hang out late with a friend or cousin, but it really depends on how strict the parent is. I have really strict parents they won't let me out at night, unless, they are with me. It's important to make new laws to protect the environment and the teenagers as well teenagers nowadays think they can do whatever they want. 10pm is kind of late it's close to midnight maybe during the weekends teenagers could hang out after midnight but during the weekdays after 10pm would be against the laws it really depends on what they are doing like are they driving in a car or walking It's scary to be out at night by yourself.
