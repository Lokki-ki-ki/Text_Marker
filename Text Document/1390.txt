Wednesday 03, 20, 2019Generic_Homeworking in Groups or Alone In school sometimes we work in groups, and sometimes we work alone. Working alone is fine because we don't get headaches from classmates; however, working in groups is better because we get extra help from classmates. Working in groups is better because we get extra help from classmates, we get more opinions, and it takes less time doing the assignment. First, working in groups is better because we get extra help from classmates. For example, we divide the assignment with our classmates. Each person has their own part to do, and we finish it faster than do it alone. Working in groups is better because we will have more contribution from classmates. Second, working in groups is better because we get more opinions. For example, every person in the group give opinions. We get more ideas if we are more than only one person. We don't have to think everything about the assignment because we will have thinking help. Working in groups is better because we get more ideas. Finally, working in group is better because the assignment will take less time to be completed. It will take less time because we will get more support and all the work won't be completed just by one person. There will be more help and each person will do a little work what means that we will finish faster because it will take us less time doing the assignment than do it alone. Working in groups is better because the assignment will take less time to be completed. In conclusion, working in groups is better because we divide the work with our classmates, we don't have to think everything about the assignment because we will have thinking help, and the assignment will take less time to be completed. Working in groups is a gift.
