I think seif-esteem come from praise, in my opinion, praising is good for student to built self-esteem by their self.especially the praise come from their teacher, you know everyone like that other guys to praise him/her, i don't want to my parents criticize to me. Even though common people, I care people's talk, Doesn't everybody cares?as a student, I understand that means in my mind, if I make some mistake, I know this is my fault early, when teacher criticize to me, I will be so sad, It is n't having a strong mind in everyone's heart, we are human not god, so don't bring blow to kid when he/ she get trouble. They are fragile, because they have different thought, more blame to others, more counter to you. You should try to encourage to them, say you are good, if student have some fault really, Don't say no, should say:I think you can do it better. It important to make progress when they are growing up. The great education is nurtured little by little early. I trust you can do it or blame them simply, Let me compare and think about it. It's not in the same way. You are distinctive! I really think that is truth. I admit you are right so long as you can say you understand by use your way. Actually right or wrong is not important. But this is serious that you want to probe the problem of to learn is necessary, we can't blow them. In a word, even thought always miss''right answer'', try to praise me and friends, you are good, and you can do better, I am also proud of myself, self-confident make me too strong, whatever they say anything, adjust mind by myself, that is prefect enough !
