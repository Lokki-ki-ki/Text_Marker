Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote,''to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment''. Although some people disagree about Emerson's statement, actually I agree because society is always trying to make people change their point of view, their culture, their believers. First never give up, Second always love and be proud of yourself and Third don't forgot your roots. Here are some reasons why I agree with Emerson's statement. First, the world is trying to make change, but you have to never have to give up. Because it's important to continue being yourself, not matter if some people are not going to like it, the only one who have to feel comfortable with yourself it's you. Second, always love and be proud of yourself. It's important to be proud of who you are because even though you make mistakes sometimes that doesn't have to make change who you are. You just have to learn from your mistakes, I know it is difficult but no one says that would be easy, but you can do it. Love yourself because every of your features, your character and your personality is what identify you, is make you unique, different from anyone else in the world that wants you to fit on it. Third, don't forgot your roots. If you are from another country you are forced to change yourself, trying to pretend that you are something else, but you must have to stop it. Because in a world that is constantly trying to make you be something else your biggest accomplishment is to show that you are better than what they expected you to be.Finally, what are you waiting for!. Don't let the world change yourself, remember to never give up always fight for is better for you, love and be proud of yourself always and don't forget your roots because every part of yourself is what make you unique, special and that is your greatest accomplishment.
