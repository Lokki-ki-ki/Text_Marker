Do curfew keep teenagers out of trouble and safe, or do they unfairly interfere in young peoples lives. And why is it good or bad for them. In my opinion I think it would be bad for them If teenagers stay until after 10 p. m and not having a curfew, so it is good for them to have it because of these three examples. If this was a law I think it would be good for them to have the curfew because they will have a time limit, and they'll know what time to not go outside, because if the stay outside until after 10 p. m they are basically breaking the law. I think it will be good for them because if they don't have it is will interfere their lives and their life schedule. And it will make them and keep them unorganized about everything. Because they can't sleep well, they won't have enough energy to keep up with their daily works. In my opinion it will be good for them to have it because, it would be more safe for them and they will be more safe, and it will keep them away from danger and trouble. Because they will know that after 10 p. m it might not be safe for them. In conclusion, it is good for the teenagers to have a time limit or a curfew for them to go outside. Because it will keep them safe and out of trouble. And it will make them and keep them organized. And the point is that if it was a law. It would've been better for them. These are my three reasons to, why it's good for the teenagers to have a curfew and make them a time limit for them to go outside.
