I think we accomplish if we are always doing something, because it will help you to learn more things, we have to always stay busy doing something if we want to achieve. Doing anything will not help you if you want to be someone in the life. One reason to stay busy doing something is that will help you to develop new things, and focus doing things that you like to do, and see your potential and be able to do anything you have in mind. Another reason is that doing something will help you to open your brain, and think positive, also have big ideas that will be very helpful for your life, if we want to be a successful person, never have to be idle. For example if you want to be a professional soccer player you have to train and work very hard everyday on it to get it, practice skills, develop your abilities. If you just watch videos on YouTube and don't do anything, that will not help you to get it, you have to put on practice to get it. Another example is if you will have a test, and you want to get an A, you have to studies your notes and not be lazy, if you just go to take the test without know anything, you will fail the test, you have to be a positive person, feel comfortable, and believe in yourself. In conclusion if we want to be a successful person, we never have to be idle, and we have to always stay busy doing something, always be positive, see the potential you have and feel able to do everything you want, and never be inactive, you have to be an active person to reach your goals. Also, you have to believe in yourself and take off negative persons of your life.
