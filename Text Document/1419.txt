People sometimes think that influencing means you have to be an example for the person, but in my opinion influencing someone could be through anything like : internet, words, a friend and even family. I disagree with Albert Schweitzer because he said, Example is not the main thing in influencing others ; it is the only thing. First reason why I think an example is not the only way to influence people. For example, I go to a party and there are people under the age of twenty-one drinking alcohol, they do not have to be someone I know for them to influence me to drink alcohol. Some people would feel pressure to do it just because the other ones are doing it. Second reason why I think an example is not the only way to influence others. The TV can influence people to buy thing from the commercials, it could be anything. People sometimes do not think about how much money they spend on stuff; at the end of day they use it once, and then forget about it. On the other hand, people think that the only way to influence someone is by an example. In addiction, my mom is someone that consider as an example for me, if she does something wrong it doesn't mean that I am going to do it, too. I think being an example is something good as long as you don't do what they did wrong. In conclusion, I think there are more ways to influence people. It could be you influencing someone else or someone including you.
