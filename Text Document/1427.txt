The author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote," To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment. Imagine in a world that is trying to change you in everyday. I'm disagree because you have right to do what you want to do with your life or who you want to be in your life and nobody has to say what you need to do. Example; all people in this world have rights, because a lot people trying to change your life, and they want you to do what they said, if you think you are right do not lessen to the people. To many times the community try to change your decision, and they do not respect what you said. That's why is a lot problem in the oblation. Example; too much politician people want to change customs and religions they can't do anything about it, because that is a decision from there culture. If you took a decision about to put your own company and your friends say you can not do that, just try to do your best and don't detention to him. Example; in a company every employer have his own rights like what time they need to be there or what time they get out the work. The reason why i choose disagree is that to many people in this world do not respect when you make your own decision, if you can do something do not worry about what people say. The solution to this problem is done what you think is right; and the county need to have a good relationship families, neightborhood, and students.
