Technology think has the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology had positive on people' live. Technology allows people to complete many tasks without having contact with others. People can check out books, shop, and play games without speaking to another person. Because technology makes people to become more single, we can do a work, or we can finish something by ourselves. For example, if I want to buy a book for my friends that he live very far from me. I do not need to go to the bookstore buy a book then call him ask him when does he have time, and we make a time to meet each other. Right now I can buy a book online, and then I type his address to delivery. I just need to wait a few days, and then he can get the book. This is the technology makes life more comfortable. If today we do not have technology, maybe we need many people to do for one work. We need cost more time. It is not a good thing for us. Time is important, in fact, we do not have too much time in our life, we need to UES the less time to finish one thing. So how can we find a way to use less time to do the work? Technology will help us. People do not need contact work together. It save many times and improve the work. We can use the less time to do more work. So that is why I think has the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology had positive on people's live.
