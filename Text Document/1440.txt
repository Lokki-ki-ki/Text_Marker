What I would like to accomplish right now I guess it would be my grades. Because they are not good I'm not doing good at any class that I have right now. My grades are bad and one thing I would like to accomplish right now I guess is my grades for the moment because now I feel that I'm going to fail all my test. That I'm having right now I'm failing all the class and I guess that's the only thing I want to accomplish for the moment I still have time to learn and study for my all my test that are coming this year hopefully I can do good. Last year I did my writing ESOL and i didn't pass the test but I got the maximum number so I can retake the test again and that time I didn't do good a fail the test I didn't know how I did the first test that I got 385 on my ESOL. Then I fail when I was going to retake it again I know that I did my best that time but is til ask my self how I fail it again I even stay after school so I could retake the test again I guess that time I was lucky. That day I guess I didn't study well I guess because this time I didn't pass it or because I was doing the test fast and I couldn't read the test or I just didn't care about it.
