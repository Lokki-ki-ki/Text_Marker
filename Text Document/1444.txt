I disagree that students should be required to take an arts as a class but as an elective they can choose between what type of art class that they want to take, for example if a student wants to take a music class as an elective they’ll have to check in with their counselor to see what class that they don't need so that empty spot can be the elective that they have chosen. Electives can be helpful to students because it teaches them something new about the history of the different kinds of arts class and help them understand what's going on around the world and teach them how to play instruments and see where the origin is from and how it is played, art is teaches student s how to paint and make clay and shows who are most the famous painters, where they’d come from and how’d they became such great artists. Drama shows who are the greatest actors, famous plays and how they became famous. Students say that an elective is better than it be a required class because it's like having free time, but you get to do something that you don't get a chance to do, and it could be a career in the future for someone who is interested in doing it and sometimes the counselor puts the students into an elective that don't like and it's not a required class and if they don't like it, they don't have a choice but to stay in the elective.Therefore, students should be able to choose their own elective rather than it to be a required class that you need to pass in order advance into the next step of life, and it will help them learn something in the future and remember what happened during their time in that they spent in that elective.
