Do you agree or disagree with extending the school day? Many students said that it's good for them to finish homework at school, but some of the students disagree this idea. I disagree with expending the school day, I think it's not good for us. First, every student have something they like to do, so students can join a club or an activity after school. If the school board adds one and a half hours to school each day, students will attend their activities late. The activity lasts about 2 hours or later, students may get home after the sun sets up. In the winter, the sun sets up so early, the day is short, it's too dangerous for the students who walk home. Second, we have about seven hours in the school every day, I think we need more time to study at home. It's quiet when we study at home. Students can use these time fully. We can learn new knowledge, do sports, review everything we learn, and so on. However, there are some new students from different countries, they can not speak English very well, they need more time to study. So, I think it's not good to expend the school day. Lastly, if the school board will not expend the school day, it can not only help us do what we want to do for a long time, but also let us have a long and good sleep. We have a lot of homework in the high school, we may finish homework late. It's not good for students. The students in the high school must sleep for about eight hours every day. If they do not sleep very well at night, they will not have good mentality to study next day, their grades may decline. These are my reasons, I disagree to expend the school day. I think my idea can help the school board to make the decision.
