After keep studying students should make positions on what they already are studying, thinking as a young age students are more creative with their minds and heart; Students should think as young age for a beneficial purpose, deciding on a career at a lower grade (8th) many societies et their students have these opportunities to choose their path and make changes on what they really want in their life, the're changing from a playful mind into a mind where teenagers start to make decisions; In reality this is a path where they would finally decide what they want or could be done for being graduated as an honorable person, by doing the most of the students frequently found what they would do and could be doing on their future as an older person, as they think they organize them self and be more clear on their positions in life. This could make a big change for teenagers, now they show they can make a more positive and strong decisions, to show that they make better decisions as a lower grade society could being tested for all middle schoolers and keep track on how do students on how they are getting ideas as they turn from Middle School to High School; Most of the students decide good careers and some of them great careers, but is not only about choosing a career is about what students could think as a teenager; having students deciding on what they think to 're going to be success. However, letting young kids think on what to 're going to study as a career would not be the best because not all students want to keep studying before High School; it would be a waste of time and effort to give them a great opportunities to start thinking as young adults, this could not benefit all students because as they get into High School they keep changing careers and by the end of their 4 school year they didn't decide what career they want to take, most of the students end up not enjoying their career and giving up deciding they shouldn't get that career and deciding to not finish the college. Therefore, students could not take a career they didn't want but if they know they could pass and be an excellent person, even in the career they didn't decide to take they could make even a better life in their future by choosing and changing the career they were thinking as they were at Middle School, they continue thinking on what they want until they reach what they're looking for in real life as a young adult.
