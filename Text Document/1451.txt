People should make their own decisions instead of seeking guidance from experts or authorities about lives important matters. I personally know that making your own decisions is better than other people making your decisions because if an expert or other person did, they could probably decide something you don't want and then regret it later in life. One reason why I know making your own decisions is better than seeking guidance from experts is because when making your own decisions you know what you're doing, but you have to think twice about it and then go with it. Like for example, if I chose to take ecosystems instead of physics I think about it twice because I know what could be the bad thing and the good thing about that class and then go for what I think is better. Second reason why I know making your own decisions is better because when a person makes a decision they made, then later regrets what they chose, they made a mistake. That's a good thing because learning from your mistake's helps you a lot and benefits the wrong and making mistake's will make you a more successful person. For example, if I were to take an exam then get the results that I failed because I got a awful grade I would try again but wouldn't give up which makes me successful. Final reason why I know making your own decisions is better because who else in this world can? It's your life and there's never going to be a person right by you telling you what do and what not to, so they have to learn by their selves because no one is. For example, what if I said I wanted to go buy a house, who should I ask to make my decision? No one because you make your own decisions in this life. These are the reasons why making your own decisions is better than seeking guidance from experts.
