Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote "To be yourself in the world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment." Currently, your accomplishments, acts, and attitude speak of you and how great you are, around the world many of the people think do something else is an act of a humble person for example: on your career, your area of work, in the school you do something it's not your responsibility, the people gesture the big heart has and how important it is show to the world you trying make something else to dial the different. I am agrees because when being yourself the people see something special on you and try to be a person you like to learn new things maybe in the first try that's no going to be perfect, but you never give up to be different around a lot of people. Three reasons for being yourself is important: first other persons going to be like you, second you going to be inspiration for everyone, third your accomplishments can change the mentality of many people around you. First being yourself is important because other person they going to be like you, in a situation like you always do the extra mile, is when you help other no matter it's no job example: in the school you explain to your friend how resolve any equation of math but is not your job in the class, because you are only a student, and it is the teacher responsibility of the teacher explain to your friend, and the accomplishment many people they going to be like second being yourself is important because you going to be inspiration for everyone, in many areas like in your house, neighborhood, school, college, including church. For example: if you neighbor look it you clean your yard or your house or helping others neighbors, like cut the grass and help each other you can be motivation for other person, that's how complete your accomplishment of be inspiration for other person. Last being yourself is important because your accomplishment can change the mentality of others, then the people see it your progressive on your life doing thing the other people ask them self, how they did it?, you can leave a message and tell them how you did it, and if you did it they can do it too. For example: in the family always we can see different type of family, one they have job but with lower salary, and one with their own company, if we are the type of person like to help your own family you going to transmit that like good vibes, hope, etc. In conclusion, like the author said is constantly we like a human trying to do extra things to have a great result and accomplishment in the life, and more than 50 percent of the world do that because the major of the person see the benefits of help to others, and the most important the world see a positive side of this massage that the author said always do something else, and our greatest accomplishment can be example for another person around of us because more than example we can be inspiration for many people in the world.
