To begin with many students enjoy summer than winter. Making winter break longer than summer and a week off in spring and fall is not a good idea. When students come back from break regardless of the season they most likely cannot retain information, because they have been gone for a long period of time. Having a longer winter break than summer is a waste of time. Why should educators feel that a longer winter break than summer could help retain information? In my point of view having a longer winter break would not be enjoyable students like the fact that they can be able to enjoy their break. Even though students cannot retain information on learning targets, at least it won't waste time because having a longer winter than summer would extend time causing time to be lost in the school year. Changing the season of the break would not be enjoyable either cause of cold weather, it would certainly not help students to remember the information they learned when they were in school. What's a break if you cannot enjoy it? In addition, what maybe the students can take into consideration is to review some things learned, during the free time on their break. Teachers should assign online classes and review's for students to help memorize information at least once a week. That way when people return to school others won't be so behind on things and can remember the objectives taught. A longer winter break could possibly help the scholar remember what was learned, if they were to revise and analyze work that was given to in the past in this situation. In conclusion changing the season would not help students retain information and is not a good idea, unless the individual were to spend time studying a few times out of the break. Overall there should not be a longer winter break than summer.
