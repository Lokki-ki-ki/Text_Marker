Some schools districts allow students to graduate within three years. This is a good idea because of legal statuses, not having financial support, and also some students having almost all required credits. One reason is my friend Generic_Name. My friend Generic_Name lives in Texas he is going to graduate with the class of 2020. Due to his mom's immigration statutes they left Virginia to go to Texas in the summer of 2019 to seek for help. In fear that his mother would be deported in less than a year he decided he would finish a year earlier than what was expected. This year Generic_Name is taking high level class while still being ahead of the game. Another reason is some students have no financial support. Some students want to go into the work force but do not want to effect their academics. Graduating early would be a great solution for them. Even some want to join the work force to earn money for college or help their families financial problems. Lastly some students have almost all credits to graduate due to taking high school classes at an earlier level. For a standard diploma in the state of Virginia you need 3 math, 3 science,4 history, 4 English, health grade 9 and 10, 2 sequential fine art, and a language. Due to some students taking some classes at earlier levels it dulls it all down for them in high school. Graduating within three years is a good idea it helps students end up with their high school diploma while also helping their problem. I agree that gradating within three years is a good idea for students who need and choose it.
