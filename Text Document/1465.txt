Some schools use cell phones in the classroom for educational purpose. People think it is a good idea for students to have phones for educational purpose. I believe students should not have phones in classrooms because students could easily get distracted, they will not have the chance to learn better, and having a phone should be a privilege. First reason why I believe we should not have cell phones for educational purpose is, students will get distracted. They will start using their phones for other purposes that are not educational or what their teacher has recommended. Students will start texting instead of doing their assigned work the teacher gave them. Students will start thinking it is okay for them to take out their phones when it is time for learning. Second reason I believe it is wrong for students to have cell phones in classroom. Students will not have the chance to learn how it used to be. Students that actually take notes have a better chance to memorize what they learned and doing better in tests. When teachers do hands on work during class students can learn and teach their peers. Last reason why I believe students should not have phones during class is, phones are a privileged to have. Teachers should not allow phones during class time because students will not know when is the right time to have phones during class. Even if they put strict rules students will find an away to go around those rules. In conclusion, this is why I believe some schools should not allow phones in classrooms. Students will get distracted, they will not get the chance to learn more, and having phones is a privilege. I believe schools should not allow students to use their phones during class.
