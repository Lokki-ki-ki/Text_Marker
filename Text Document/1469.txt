Summer is a hot and nice season and most students need time to enjoy the break and here is why, so first off most students go on vacation out of state or country to visit family members, and they stay longer than three to four weeks. When visiting family you need time to be with them and enjoy time with them, because you won't get to see them often when you leave. Even if the student stays for two weeks and the student returns they will not have enough time to do their summer assignments or to gather materials for school. One month is not enough time and not fair when us students go 10 months straight to school, two months and couple days is a good amount of time to relax.Also, when it is summer there are plenty of activities to do like go to national parks, amusement parks, water parks, play outdoor sports, have gatherings with family members, and relax at home. I mention these type of activities because they are not available in other seasons like fall, winter, and spring. There should not be a week break in fall, because first there are no special holidays or reason why we should have week off, also if no school for a whole week and Columbus Day people will start to get the habit not to come to school. Although a longer break would be nice for the winter, all we need to have is two weeks for Christmas and New Years. We need to have more time to learn and be prepared for future exams, especially if some students do not have good grades and are falling behind on their work. Some may argue that two months and a couple of days is too much, but parents would not like it if their child was starting to stay home and not go to school. We need to have all the time in the world to be educated and be caught up on all missing assignments. Finally, it might seem that most students will forget information during the summer, it will not matter because the student will not be learning the same information as last year.
