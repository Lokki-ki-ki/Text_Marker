In most student's summer, they learn different things from their break, such as work experience, new knowledge from a book, and tradition about other country;In this cause, teacher's designed is not a good choice for student's project, because teacher can not make suitable choices for students, so the way can help students more understand about what they can do in the summer project is student's designed. When the summer break start, student can make a lot of choices about their plan in the summer, for example, they can stay home, travel to somewhere, or work at some place they like;Most student's summer break have a lot different, they learn different things from their break, teacher could not really know what happen in student's break, this is why student need designed their own title. In halfway of the summer, some student might not even start making their project, in this cause if teacher give student a hard title, such as"after you read this book, what your opinion and what you learn from this book?", then student have tried rush through the book, and start making a project, it will make student have a bad project content, if student can decide they own project title, such as"base on your break, what you learn from your travel, it can be anywhere", if student can create their own project title, it will be a lot interesting and easy. Most student want to learn a new thing from interesting activity, and spend a time on those things, and student always know what whey like to do, they can create title base on animals, vehicles,or their life experience, it will be so much fun and efficiency will improve, if they can decide their own project title. Between teacher's designed and student's designed, student always like to make their own choices, they can learn things from activity they are interesting, talk and share experience with their friends, and have an easy project in their summer, that's why student's designed better than teacher's designed.
