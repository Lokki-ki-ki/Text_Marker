I agree with being honest because holding the truth for so long can hurt a persons feeling whether you know them for long. Being honest is a good choice because it is over to get easily without lying and worrying about it later on about it and what you did. Lying about something you did do could get you to make the person believe that they aren't your friend or aren't special to you but telling to truth means that they can also tell honesty and how loyal you are. Lying would make it hard for you in your life (future) and the people who care a lot for you because they wouldn't trust you ever again or talk to you. It'll make it harder for you to communicate with them when you see them or try to talk. Later on your life lying would make you regret what you did and why you did it because you'll lose someone in your life as well as the person you love. Being honest with you family and friends would be the best choice because later on your life you don't have worry about any regrets on your actions on what you did.
