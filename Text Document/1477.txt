The technology has improved this year's, allows people to makes think much faster than before and the technology every day It's going to keep improving. I think that Technology makes thighs easier for everyone but especially for does that can't walk, speak or heard. Technology makes thinks much easy and quickly for everyone, If you don't have a car you can shop online. People can buy food, materials, video games, books and everything that in necessary. Technology also makes easier to talk with people that is far away, and you miss. Last year I call my grandmother, and she never had a cellphone before, she was surprise that she was talking to me event that she is far away from me that makes me so happy, and I was thinking that if technology does not exist I don't know how to communicate whit does people that are far away from me. Technology is very important this day's, for everyone but if we used for good because there is some people that use technology to do bad thinks and that way technology have some negative effects on peoples lives. The limitation of human contact has something to do with technology because there is some people that don't know how to use technology they think that technology is the only way, and they feel like there is no other friends but that wrong because technology it's a tool for human and if we know how to use it's going to makes us life much easy. In my opinion technology its one of the best tool that we have, but we have to lean how to use because it can help us a lot and makes us much easy many thinks, but there is only one rule we have to used for good.
