MEMORANDUM See no problem not a big issue about using cell phones at school, a lot of students need the cell phones to stay informed or to keep in contact with the parents, students can use cell phone in case of an emergency at school. Cell phones are a safe thing for the students at these times. Some students don't have a way to search a subject or a problem because they don't have a computer with, so the cell phone is faster, and small easy to look through, share ideas with other students, point of view about a subject, political opinions, stay informed what is going on outside of school, students have to be informed about everything that happens outside of school, bloquing students devices can cause a bad effect and this will make then find other way to brake the rules again, and get what they want. I think students should be allowed to use cell phones for these reasons. However, some students can take to other side, and don't pay attention in class because of the cell phones, a big part use cell phones to play games, or get distracted with music, and this can affect a lot of other students in the class, use too much of the cell phones also affect the social media. Using social media at school can cause a bad point of view of the school, examples of it can be recording fights, or sexual things. Most teachers don't allow students using cell phone during class because students can be out of the subject that the teacher is trying to teach, this can be a rock inside the boot.
