Dear principal I think they should help to do require community service because some kids don't community service. What about who gets in bigger trouble how to are required to do community service. The kids not in trouble don't how to do community service. It's a good an idea. Do you like my option? Some people don't like to do community service. They say too much work.I say it not lot work to if you help out.
