Most employers are looking for specific characteristics in a potential employee. Many people may not have experience and never, but I'll be a great candidate to hire because I'm hard-working, and I'm responsible. I'm a great candidate that employers are looking for because I spend time volunteering at school and working with job owners as a helper. I take care of people kids and work as a school bookkeeper all school year. However, some people may think having more experience is better than being responsible, having experience help but having responsible help employers trust you more with important job. But I manged how many people check out book of school and I clean the library sometimes. Later in the year I volunteer at a two company has a filer. I plan paper for employer because they know that I'm responsible to do the job and get done. In addition, I'm a hard-working person because I have a job and play sport but I my time to volunteer some time. I do a lot of work, so I don't have to do anything later or the next day. I was a food sticker at my job, but now I'm a manager. Because I work every day and put all my heart to complete my job every day. I never miss a day at work are late I come to work ready I check if every is done if not I do it before the store open and set plan for the day. I put one hundred percent in to everything I do in life to finish with my task. In fact, most people are lazy and don't want to do any work are complete any task there boss gave them, but a hard-worker will get the job done than a lazy person. But I may not have any experience, but I'm hard-working and responsible to do my job on time and responsible to do important work for employers and other people that ask for help. Even though I don't have any experience, I'll be a good candidate to hire for the job.
