Dear principal I agree with the school cafeteria plans because our health would be better if we eat healthier than chunk food, It will make us not get obese and fell into depression, healthier food makes your body be more active. Does healthier food make your health healthier?, is obesity a problem for students?. Healthier food would make our health be healthier, Instead of eating chunk food we should eat healthier school lunch, because If we eat healthier food it will be easier for us to do any sport because when we eat chunk food our stomach feels heavier than when we eat healthier food, professional athletes they maintain their shape because they always eat healthier food. It will make us not fell into depression, When we eat chunk food, and we don't eat any healthier food it makes us get fat and when we can't stop eating it makes us go to the level that we get obese and when we get obese a lot of students fells into depression because they don't like that way they look after they weight increase. Obesity is a big problem for our health, because it can take you to the level that you will not be able to walk. Healthier food makes students be more active, when we eat healthier our body don't feel to heavy, so we are able to move faster than when we chunk food. Chunk food makes stomach heavier that after we eat it makes so lazy that we don't e want to do anything after lunch. Healthier food activates our brain like when we do exercise we activate our body. In conclusion I think it's a great idea this new plan, changing the school menu into healthier food because it will make our health be healthier, It will help us not fell into depression, It will make us be more active. Healthier food is the best the school cafeteria can do for us because they will help us prevent obesity, and they will help us take care of our health.
