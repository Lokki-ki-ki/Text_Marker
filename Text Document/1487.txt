I think students should have the opportunity to choose their own classes as electives rather than taking a class in the arts because if they were assigned to a class they know nothing about then that would be setting them up for failure and I do strongly believe that is not the right way to go about things especially in the school district. We cannot let the students fail because it is important to have something to look forward to when they arrive to school. It is a definite requirement for students to take classes such as music, drama, and art however, it would be fair to let them decide on their own behalf. Once a student picks the class they would hopeful and full of joy to attend to it every day. I believe that no matter what a student can decide what they believe in and have nod ought about it. The students should have the ability to be successful in school if they put their minds into it. Although if the councilors put students in the classes they dislike in my opinion, the student will most likely not attend to the classes they were assigned to. Furthermore, It would be appropriate to encourage students to choose the right fit class they would want to enroll in. I challenge you to go through with this action to let the students decide on their own.in conclusion, given this opportunity for the students it will increase the satisfaction rate and expand on more ideas for the school in the future. The students will become positive and get good grades because they made a decision that could possibly impact their future goals.
