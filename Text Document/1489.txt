I think some students take a class at home because they live to far, or they not have any transportation however the students can study for video or for online, but I think that is not benefit because it better to learn more going to the school, for example the teacher they want to theirs students learned but something they can put a lot of homework because they want to their students learned however some student they live to farm from the school, but they take the bus, or they take the train and another transportation because they want a do something on the future, but is not bad idea to the students take class on the home because everyone wants to do something on the future for example if you someone wants to do something on the future they need to going to the school or take class for online because the school very important however not everybody has the same opportunities. But I think the online class is not benefited for the students because they can not learn better maybe the students they can not concentrate good at home because they dist rate for something, and they cannot learn about the lesson and maybe the teachers they cannot teach good however on the schools the students they cannot dist rate, and they put attention when the teachers teach the lesson better however they force the students to put attention because the teacher wants their students learned.However, some people they don't have the opportunities to going to schools, but they pay a class for online maybe they work the all day, and they want to study, for example, the Hispanic people they work immigrant to this country but the work hard to pay the rent and other bills but some people they want to learn English to have a better work so for the reason they pay for online class because they wants to learn other language, or they want to have a better job so for the reasons is benefit for they pay for online class however not everyone has the same opportunities. The school is very important but some students does like the school and some students like the school because they want to do someone on the future so if the students wants to do something on the future they need to have a dream because the person does have a dream they don't due anything because we can take the opportunities to the parents give to their children's because some children son the world they want to have any opportunity. But in my opinion some people are possible to take a class for online maybe is not possible to their going to schools, but they can pay classes for online but is not the same as the schools, but they can cue if they have dreams they can cue because everybody has dreams.
