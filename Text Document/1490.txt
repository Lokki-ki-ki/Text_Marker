Yes, I do agree, because it's a great way of learning because we don't have to deal with other kids in school, we're safe because we are home, we don't have to worry about going out to the dangerous world that we in now. For example, I have friends that do school at home, and they are just like regular kids from High School, a lot of people would say that being home school It's like going to prison, but it's not, home school just gives us a better way of learning at home with no one to bother. Another benefit of being home school is that you never have to worry about school shooters bad people in school, getting abuse in school, not dealing with any problems with other students. Another benefit of being home school is that you don't have to wake up early in the morning to go to school, you don't have to miss the bus anymore, don't have to worry about sports, staying after school, basically you have freedom to do more stuff, a lot of people in high school don't have time to go out or have some fun, not many kids are able to go out because their parents are strict and don't let them out, but that's besides the point, many kids take advantage of home school some of those kids, they have parents that travel around the world and they don't have a chance to sit down and talk about what is going on in school or the everyday life, their parents will take their kids with them because they don't want their kids to be home alone, instead they take the kids with the, so they don't have to miss out on their avenues, and a lot of these kids are very talented and ready for the outside world because their education was high quality and always on point. They are good kids and bad kids that do home school, some of them could have got in an OT of trouble and it's not able to go back to school and some kids are home school because their parents have to work out of the country, and they can be home by their selves, and they take their kids with the. That's all I have to say.
