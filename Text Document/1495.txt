It is wonderful how if we are always joining something. If always we're doing something we got more that we think before. We need to practice everything. We need to practice something that we want. Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something? We need to think that's what is that we want to accomplish more that we think. If I want to be a police I will study hard to be more that a police. I want to buy an iPhone 5, but I will work more to buy an iPhone 8. I want to go to Generic_City with $600, but I will save more to got $1000. We need think before to do something. We need to learn to save money. If we're doing nothing we never got something that us want. We need to work because if we do not work we never can buy something that we want. If I want to pass the SOL of Geometry I need study but if I don't want study I will not pass the SOL. I want a good future but if I'm doing nothing I will have a future bad I will study and work to have a better future. We need to think in the future before doing nothing. Determine never to be idle. I don't want to be an idle but if I don't be an idle I will never have everything that I want. I want a car Toyota, but I will work hard, and think like an idle to work more hard and get more money to buy a BMW. Furthermore, I need pass all the class to graduate, but I want a diploma better that normal one I will do all homework to pass all the class. We need to be an idle to got everything that we want. In conclusion, It is wonderful how if we are always joining something. Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something? Determine never to be idle. But if we want thing that speed a lot of money we need to be an idle to got more money, or we want graduate we need study more that other to be better person in the future. For this reason and many others we need to be an idle.
