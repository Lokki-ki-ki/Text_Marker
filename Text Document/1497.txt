Since I was a little kid my dreamed job has always to be a mechanic, and you might ask why do I want to be a mechanic well; when I was little I remember watching my dad fixing cars all day long, at the end of a long day of work I always got played with my bicycle and whenever my bicycle got broken I remember running to my dad telling him to fix it, and I loved watching him fixed it, so whenever I was not with him, I always knew how to fix it by myself, when I started to grow I began helping my dad more, he never actually led me work on a car because he said that was it dangerous, but when I was going try had to come to the United States and I never learned nothing about car so now that I'm big I'll love to learn more about car and how to be a mechanic. To be honest I remember telling my dad that one day I was going to be the greatest mechanic of all the time because I wanted him to saw that I could do it and make him feel proud I remember him smiling and telling me that could become whatever I wanted to be in this world I just had to worked for it and don't stop until I reached my goal, the only memories I have with my dad are me working with him, we did not spend too much time together I only saw him when he was at work and some weekends because he did not leave together but now that I'm big, and I can make my own decisions and have the opportunity to be anything in this country I want to be a mechanic and make my dad proud. I know that been a mechanic is not easy, and it takes a lot of skills, patience and practice but if I ever get the opportunity I won't waste it I will give my best and I will focus and try to give it all because my that once told me ''nothing is impossible it can be very hard but not impossible'' I'm always having those words in my mind because I'm that type of person that it won't stop until it gets what he wants and all I want is to lean how to be a mechanic and while doing it make my dad proud I'll love to have the opportunity to explore a mechanic company I'll be very thankful for giving me that opportunity. I'm also looking to be a mechanic because I love cars and when I get a new job I will buy my own car and if learn how to be a mechanic I won't have to pay somebody to fix my car when I could fix it by my own when I always had like and obsession to open stuff and take everything how see how every little thing makes a function and how all together make a hole system works and when I'm finished taking everything out I like to put them all together as before and if put everything how it was maybe that's why I like math so much because in math there are many ways to salve something and at the end they all give the same answer and cars work almost the same way and I would like to open a car and find what is wrong and see how to fix it and get paid by what I love to do
