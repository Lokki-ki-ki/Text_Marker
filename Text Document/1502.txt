I feel like if students want to graduate in three years or two years they should talk to someone like there teachers, and they can ask them if there GPA is low.there are a lot of ways that they can help them for an example if they are failing any classes then they can take some classes online, or if they can go to night school, or stay after school for more help. There is an another way for them, they can go to school summer, and they can take classes the ones that they fail or take some other classes the ones that they need to take if they don't want to keep on going to school. Also if they stay in school, no abuses, and stay out of trouble they can probably graduate in three years. If their bad grades are low or GPA they can take an another class that can bring up there grade up like, do a sport, like soccer or art. Or they can ask a teacher if they can change there class where there were is two teachers. I feel like my school they should let students graduate with a low GPA because there are some students that have a hard time keeping up there grades up like. If they have a brother, or sister that they have to take care of, or they have to work two jobs to help there parents out. But I feel like students shouldn't work while going to school because that how they get bad grades and can't bring up any grades up. What I like about my school is that they let students pass there sol's with a 375 or more the ones that are in small group and that they need more help.
