I agree with Ralph waldo when he said's "to be your self in a world that trying constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishments."although being yourself is a very hard thing to do especially when you have nobody buy your side though it all at first it seems easy but once you try so hard to make people proud you would want to feel like citing in. But yet again here we are learning from our own mistakes why try to make our self just what others want us to be, why can't we just be us for just simply pleasing ourselves I wish we wouldn't care what people think about us but do, but we have to face reality sadly weather we like it or not there's no alternatives. Because what's the point?, just to be something we are not, for example one we would be lying to ourselves and second either way no matter how much we try It's never enough for anyone because at the end of the day how we choose to be either our self or not nobody will ever be pleased with our decisions not the other way around. Sometimes our influences may pros wade us and to a certain point we try so hard not to fit in but the people that we hang around the most we reflect upon them even if we see it or don't at the end of they day they try, but the real question is do they succeed? Yes but only temporary nothing lasts forever everything has its timing when it should or won't come to our lives. I mostdefinlty agree to being yourself is a huge accomplishment, but we might not understand at the moment, how or why, but we will soon rather than later at first its complicated even difficult although its just temporary things that occur in that priest moment it can also be for our great or good, but we should've been proud of what didn't Thad happen. So I believe sticking with yourself is always the best policy don't worry what people say about you, you know where you stand don't let anyone tell you so plus being yourself will mark the difference in you people can't always tell what you are they don't define you that's for you to decide not them, So don't be embarrassed of yourself show yourself off believe in yourself because your limit is and only you. Thank you for your time hope to hear from you very soon. SincerelyGeneric_Name
