I disagree with the school board extending the school day by one and a half hours extra. Because Students will not have enough sleep with one and a half hours extra of school with homework, also students will have less free time, and also student wouldn't have enough time to go spend with there family. If the school board extended the school day by one hour and a half then students wouldn't have enough time to sleep because they have to do there homework, and that take probably one to two hours to finish there homework, and then they will have to eat and get ready for bed. I like have my free time to do mostly what I want to do but if the school board extended's the school by an hour and a half then we wouldn't have as much time for free time, and we wouldn't be able to go outside and play with are friends or play video games, everything that you like to do will be shorter. Do you like spending time with your family I like spending time with family but if the school board extends the school day by one hour and a half then you won't have as much time to be and spend with your family like going outside for a walk or playing games or going out places like to eat and those times are going to be making memories not being in school most of the time?That's why I think students shouldn't have school extended one hour and a half, so they can have more time to do there homework and have more time to sleep, and so that they can have enough time to play video games and play outside with their friends, and finally, so they can spend time with there family and do fun activities with them.
