According to the text I think is a good idea that students can graduate from high school in three years because if you graduate from high school very early you are going to get a lot of opportunities to be successful in life, I also think that if someone decides to start working contraction or hard works like that early, three years later that person going to get a lot of experience and money and if you decide go to college or some like that when you graduate from college you're going to be young and ready for life, that's how a lot of people became millinery, because they must time you spend doing something that's more experience that you're going to get, and when you got experience, and you know what you're doing, and what you want your life going to be better and easier in the future. People also think that it is a bad idea graduate from high school in three years because they said that is too early, and you don't go to be smart enough to be successful in life, but I said" that's wrong because we still have to go to summer school and take extra classes in summer school, and you have to be very smart because you need to pass all you classes you cannot fail any class because if you fail one you need to take it in summer school again and that's going to be a problem so if you want to graduate early you also have to take classes online, so you're going to be very busy, so they should be ready for the next level. I know someone that he is from the Dominican Republic, but he leaves in Generic_City, I went to one of his barbershop and I ask him" what did you do to be so successful? He told me this" when I was 16 years old I graduate from high school' then I ask "how you graduate so early, and he told me that he take classes in summer school, and he takes classes online" I said that's good "keep telling me how you became successful" and he told me that after he graduate he went to college to take classes the barbershop 3 years later he was only 19 years old, so he has to work for one year if he wants to open his own busyness then after that he open three barbershops in Generic_City he said if you put you best effort to the thing you, and life going to get better everything. Another thing is that not everybody makes it, is hard but I have I tip for those type of people never give up just do you best and put you hurt to it and put you best effort because at the end your mom and dad don't go to be there to pay for you food you're going to be the man in that house so that's why everybody needs to work hard every day if they want to be successful in life. In conclusion the best thing for student in graduate early because they must experience you get doing something the must money you're going make and for me life is about perseverance, progress, and be successful because if you don't got nothing nobody going to respect you, and you need to help the people that cannot make it because people fail sometime life is not that easy for some people is you got the opportunity to do it good in life take that opportunity.
