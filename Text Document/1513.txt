Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, "unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow." Based on your experiences, do you agree or disagree with Emerson's statement? Take position on this issue. I believe what author Ralph Waldo wrote is true. First reason, why I agree on what the Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote. I think if you don't work hard for what you want, you will never accomplish it. Also believe in yourself and be confident, if you have skills use them. However, someone peoples have skills, but are not confident with their self. Practice or training will help you be successful. Second reason, why I agree on what the Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote. In my experienced I wasn't confident I would be shy to present my project. Although, I got my first job and helped me a lot with my fear. Now when my teachers asks who want to present I will raise my hand first, so I can get over it. Lastly, why I agree on what the Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote. In my second experienced I was good at algebra and my other subjects, but my junior year I gave up when my grades dropped to a zero. In my second semester I started bringing my grades to at least a C, to make my mom proud. Until this day I feel proud of myself too. In conclusion, you should not give up on something you love to do nor let someone tell you what you can and cannot do. Author Ralph Waldo Emerson is right, work hard, and you will be successful.
