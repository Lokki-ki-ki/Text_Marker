I think that he is right in what he thinks, about the consists of succession going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm, because if you lost your enthusiasm in something that you are doing you loss the interest in it, but if your enthusiasm is to do it, you can do it many times you want the failure is just a little rock in your way to made your personality more incredible and unique from other that just give up at the first time. Enthusiasm is everything you need, when you want to star something, without enthusiasm we can have a lot of failure if we don't try again and again, it is like the main function of your brain, your personality, and your attitude, to don't have any failure in your life, someone with a great enthusiasm is someone with many opportunities in his life, someone with a good control about what he wants and what he does, someone who doesn't give the opportunity to fail in what he is doing, failure will be always right there in from of you, but you are the only one who accept it or not. An example of failure can be, ; like when someone went to ask for a job but, he doesn't have the job because he didn't finish the high school that is failure in his life, but he decides to retake the high school in his free time, and he graduate from it, he can back for ask in the same job, he is contracting at this time it was because he has a great enthusiasm in his life, he never stops because he didn't have the job at his first try he continues, and he did it. I know not everything is rose color, but sometimes you need a bit of failure in your life, to see how brave you are and how strong are you for the life situations, failure it's not mean that you are a loser, not it's mean that you are training for the difficult situations in the life but with just a good enthusiasm you can do it again and again has many times you want to do that is my conclusion about how failure can affect your life.
