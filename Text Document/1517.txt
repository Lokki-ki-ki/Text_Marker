In the actuality, many schools have been a good support for all the students that want to continue studying, and have goals for their life, the schools provide opportunities and have partnerships with companies that allow students explore certain occupations. It's hard for many students to choose the career they want to study, some students leave school after high school, so they lose great opportunities that the school provides, but my dream is to have passion for a job, so I want this opportunity to make a good decision whether if I want to study marketing, through internships and shadowing opportunities that the school provide. I'm really interested in this opportunity because I want to learn more about marketing, which is the business of promoting sales of a product, as by advertising and packaging, also learn about inform new innovations and persuade the people; I'm really creative, I enjoy making posters, using social media, talking with people, and I can speak Spanish, English, and a little of French, also I want to have organization and administration of the things, however, I'm interested in pursuing that type of employment, that the manager of a business can tell us his experience, to motivate us because if you want something you will never give up, I will always put all my effort to be a better person. In conclusion, I hope I can have this opportunity, to make sure if marketing is the job I want for the rest of my life because it's really important to choose the correct job, the people need to have passion for the things that they do, so they can enjoy and be happily everyday, and I want to transmit that feeling for everyone.
