It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change. Based on my experiences, I disagree with this statement, first impressions are made by everyone, but it is not impossible to change. Your first thoughts of someone. Everyone makes first impressions of people before even getting to know them by the way they dress, and looks. Some first impressions can be changed and some can't be. First impressions is a human thing, I believe that everyone has at least made a first impression of someone and their first impressions can be impossible for them to change, or it can be changed. The way someone's appearances can be affected by first impressions by so many ways. That is a major cause that is first seen. The way you are approached. My Experiences can be said some of my first impressions can be hard to change, or I can be wrong about someone and my first impressions can be way off, and that person turns out to be nothing like what I have thought. This statement can be argued from two sides. Sometimes it can be impossible to change what your first thoughts can but than other times it can be changed. One major first thoughts of a person can be the way an other person dresses, the way they look they way the walk, the way they talk. There are so many things a person can have first thoughts about a human being and just assume things about before even getting to meet. There is a lot of people in this world who's first impressions are impossible for them to change and would never change. But than theirs many other people who's first impressions are changed. In conclusion, I believe that first impressions can be changed by my perspective, It is hard for someone to change the way they think of someone, but that's why it's called ''first thoughts'' because it can be changed over time the way you look at someone can start to be seen differently, and your thoughts will change.
