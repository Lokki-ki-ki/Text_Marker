BEING YOURSELF. Being yourself is by far the most fulfilling accomplishment any individual would have ever made. Not only does it take a lot of confidence, devotion, and self acceptance, but also the ability to learn, understand and love yourself both internally and externally. People tend to have different role models for various reasons, for example my younger sister always wanted to be like the famous singer Beyonc√© because she had a beautiful voice. They might have some things in common which draws them closer to the idea of being just like them. Little do they know that them turning out exactly just like their role models is almost impossible because they lack their unique personality traits and acquire their own completely different set of traits which makes them who they are. The sooner people realize that each individual is unique in one way or another the better. Being yourself does not mean breaking the rules because you like it but doing the right thing in your own unique way. Not only does that stand out but also makes you feel good about yourself. A perfect example would be comedian Liza Josh from YouTube who made a whole career out of being unapologetically herself while she did comedy!. Using her as inspiration would be healthier than aspiring to be just like her. With that I conclude that being yourself is not necessarily a walk in the park but putting effort into it would make a bigger difference than following the crowd. Ideas lead to actions and by visualizing yourself doing things correctly but in your own way is killing two birds with one stone! Author Waldo Emerson was right about being yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else being the greatest accomplishment.
