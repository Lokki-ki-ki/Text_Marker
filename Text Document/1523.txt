In my opinion as a student: I don't agree at this type of method, but the same time is good for students and teachers to learn every day, life is like a school we never stop learning something every day and acquire new experience and skills in our grammar. I should go neither everybody need their will to vote what they want to do or spend their summer break as they like. Like you see is their break and is not fair to obligate a student to do a project without a vote to give them a choice to pick if they want to do it or not. Example; like the elections a President can't be a President without votes, the country pick their own candidates and the citizens give the vote to the person they pick best for their countrymen likely everything have a vote in our community function nothing move without a vote to people is fair to vote, that how it works
