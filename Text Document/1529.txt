I strongly agree when the Former British Minister Winston Churchill say how failure takes an extremely important position in success. To success, you have to fail many times as you need to the same thing, so you can get it right and success on in. Success is the desire of outcome in many goals in life, is the gaining of wealth and fame, Success is to attain desire of doing what you like even know you are going to have to fail on it many times doing in it. Success consists of going from failure to failure because nothing is perfect in life. During life, you are always going to have ups and downs every day, you are going to lose people because you might be doing something that they don't like, or maybe You might be facing some obstacles that stop you from success and doing what you like. During success, you are going to lose your enthusiasm in what you are trying to success in. You are going to start thinking I can't do this because I have done it many times and I always fail on it or I can't do this because my friend's and family members say I can't do it because when I do it I always comes up wrong. Failure consists in falling to do something, it consists in the inability to do something or perform To success you are always going to fail and fail and fail till you get it right. You are going to face many difficulties doing what you like or the choices that you make but in the end there is going to be a purpose for what you are doing. You are not going to success on something right away when you know is the first time you are doing it, you have to take steps by steps to take it. There are so many things that are going to be wrong, they are going to be times that you are going to fail on what you are doing. There are going to be times when people are going to try to put you down and tell you that you can't do it just because it's your first time trying it, and you fail it in your first time. And your enthusiasm is going to come down and down each day for everything that people tell you. But you have to always keep your enthusiasm up. Because enthusiasm consists in strong and a warm feeling that tells you that you're always have to keep strong and keep your head up in what you are doing."success consists of going from a failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"is one of the Quotes you always have to keep on mind when you are doing something the first time.
