Self-confidence is really important for people to feel good about their own selves. Building self-confidence may be hard on some students because the way they are raise or the way they are treated by others; Students should be able to build up self-esteem for their own good reasons in life, learning may be hard on some students at first but is just one of the task they have to get through putting a lot of effort in to it wot be that hard getting it done will be; Others may believe that praise given for deficient work undermines learning by lowering standards. Students should be able to do work that they understand good enough at their own risk to make the effort of being self-confident. Some people may not agree just because building up self-confidence is not an easy thing to do or even an easy thing to accomplish in life. Does true Self-esteem come from praise or does it come from achievements? Self-esteem comes from achievements; Achievements that you got to make the risk for put up in life throughout school. There I'll be some difficult times when you will want to give up in life times when you will feel like you just can't do it anymore, but students struggle with their own personal problems, but they can get through it all and that is what makes the build-up self-confidence about the risk and task they make in life.
