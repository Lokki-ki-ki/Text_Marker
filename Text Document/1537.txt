In the quote, Thomas Jeff her son take about determine will never to be idle and wonderful to be if all of come to and accomplish many things come to one people and serve purpose in you life.IN my point of view, Thomas Jefferson tray to say if all the colonies come and vote if they want to stay with under great British control or come join to fight for Avery freedom. Bay the way do not frog at we blood for British we die for British we won France Indian and war in the end what the king do take all new land control if we can not go in the new land because kings and they friends or nobles can go to the new land. Then way we have to pay tax to a king who do not care about his people in the colonies, But only care about money and power he won't then. What you won't no one say nothing then Jones watches say if we do not fight we're living a life like slaves, we do not say thing Avery child and wife and bread a very house take Avery food and money. Or be killed my British because they think all of as are traders they duty to kill as all for they king. But what about in sad woman and child will die because we do not come to fight for freedom and Justice labile or if you die for freedom you die a man not a slaves. And what Thomas Jefferson books he writes or the words in but on newspaper. Open American eye and think that right we do not have to list to king anymore because we American, and we have demarcation we vote for Avery leader in the end Thomas Jefferson and Jones watches and they great people in end one man can not hand wide of the earth to gad come groups we can to anything.
