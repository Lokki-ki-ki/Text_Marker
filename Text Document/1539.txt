According to the Generic_School, that believe that 70% high school students change their mind about what career they want to do after high school. I believe that high schools should never let students choose specific courses because, some of the students don't even have in mind what they're trying to do after high school, another reason is that they're way too young to choose something that is going to affect your whole life, my last reason is that students may change their mind and choose another course and the school is not going to let them choose another course. High school students change their mind all the time we may want to be a doctor today and tomorrow we want to be a barber or want to go to the army, for example my best friend go to a school like that you have to choose some specific courses so when you get graduate you don't be confused about what you're going do in college, and he told me that he's trying to go to a different school because that school doesn't let him change his courses because he was trying to be a firefighter, but now he changes his mind and want to a doctor. We high school students are way too young to choose some specific courses for our careers I believe they should make a conference and discuss all that with our parents. My final reason is because students not really sure about what are we trying to do in my opinion they should let us do that on the student's senior year because, on their senior year students have a clear mind set of what they're going to do after students graduate, like my other friend that go to Generic_School now he's a senior, and he's going to be doctor, so the school just want him to take the nurse and biology class. In conclusion, I believe that school should never let students choose their classes or courses, even though it would be nice if you want to be a doctor for example the school should force you to take doctor's relate classes, so you can get use to do things that doctors does.
