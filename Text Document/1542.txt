I believe students should not be required to take a music, a drama, or an art class. Therefore, it should be an elective. Not every student is excellent in the same things. However, taking a required class a student may not desire or need in the future can cause a student to fail. I believe students should not be required to take any of those classes because it's pointless, unfair, and not important. To begin with, it should be an elective because not every student will need any of those classes to become a successful person. Other students may want something dissimilar for their future that has nothing to do with singing, art or drama. It's also not helping a student to become smarter or to learn more. It's nowhere near educational related. Furthermore, it wouldn't be entertaining for students who do not want to take the class. The second reason I certainly believe it is unfair to make it a requirement because it can cause them to fail and hold them back from graduating. It also shouldn't be a class that should hold you back from moving forward on to college. Students would feel as if it were a pathetic reason for them to repeat a grade over a class that is useless. In conclusion, I believe that it should not be required classes to take. It's not important for students to take any of those classes. It's not a class that will help or provide a student to get a job. Majority jobs don't require for you to have any of those classes.
