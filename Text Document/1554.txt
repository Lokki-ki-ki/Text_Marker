Well It's going to be ah good benefit but in the same time it's a bad benefit to doing class in the house.(03/10/2020). The opportunity they not miss one class and be in you house is the best thing the can happen to one school students, this benefit the school and the students because they're never going to miss one day of school and the homework and tests to. In the actually some kids miss the school for be sicks, some familiar pass away, they in vacation, and they not return in time to the country, they miss the bus school, and they can't go to the school because they not have car, oh they wake up late. This is a benefit because they can learn about the class oh activity and not miss homework oh test and be prepared for the next class in the school, and be in his house relaxing and be in a safe place and always have readied you homework oh test to next class and its ah good benefits to the people ho it's in the hospital and can go to the school for ah broken left oh medical condition. But not everything it's good about this idea some kids maybe oh actually they going to stop going to the school and stay in his house and skiing the school. this is it's going to affect them because they can't sociable with other people, they can have ah computer oh in his house, they not have wife oh cellphone and other guys oh kids will skip the online class to and go play video games, and they parents are not going to have idea about what his kid did oh do, and during the test they can copy using this class papers oh using his phone to find out the answers. (In my case I will always if they give me the opportunity to online classes I will always stay in my house relaxing in my bed when I listening the class) but in the end this option of learn in his house have his good and bad benefits (some school in the United States are not using this because they not have personal websites and can guaranteed if the student are going to use this) .(I have one idea in how they can do this in ah good way. The students' ho miss the school need to call the school and inform why they're not going to the school and need they have a parent in his house, then they send them the link of the online class and notify the parent if they are doing work, oh they are skiing the online classes, and they can have ah limit time of online classes, so they can be focused to his work and dot on time and when they are doing ah test they're doing the test in a video conferencing with one teacher if they and not charting oh copy during the test. ). My personal opinion:In my opinion its ah good offer because sometimes I miss the school bus and I can't go to the school because I not have ah car and I always miss the class, homework and tests, and this can be help me a lot to have all the work in time and be prepared for the next day of school and be ready take the class oh to take one test .one sad fact:In the inter world some kids can have this opportunity to have online classes in some countries around the world they not have the technology to do that so if they miss the school one its like they are missing one day of his life and fact even they are kids ho not are going to the school because the parents not have money to send them to the school (yep in some countries the education cost money, and they not have free schools like United States) and they have to work in one short age to help his family in my country was like this thanks to good I was low to go to the school thanks to my mother and come her to the United States so when I come to the school her in United States and I hear students said I hate the school and i want to be in home I remember my country and I said thanks to this country for give me free education (even in her, they do video school conferencing to the people ho not coming to the school and I said wow, Even they do that for the students, and the students are doing protest to have more off days so what I try to say is always thanks to you parents for the education they are give to you and thanks always to you country to give you free education to you can be someone in you future and have a nice work and never ask why I not have this. And always think some in around the world not have the stuff the have, and always thanks to GOD for the stuff you have (I always do that when I wake up). Extra fact:In some countries i the world like China, South Korea, Russia... etc., the education in video its legal in all school this is because they think the education its have to be like the all days appear pencil and uniform (some schools in United States more in the private schools) and they not use laptops to do classes they have to read every single book and the attendance its obligatory what I read if you miss the school in that countries they punch you in the hands with one metal stick (like in some countries in South America) and the leave detention in the school, and you have to written in 10 oh 20 pages the I have to come to the school every day. Sometimes they stay in the school all day because they need study for ah test. If some countries (South Korea) its legal have computers and cellphones in the school. In South America yeah they can cellphones and laptops in the schools but the problem it's the internet so many people have to steal the wife to his neighbor.
