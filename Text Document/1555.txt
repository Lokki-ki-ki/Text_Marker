I believe on what Mr. Emerson said about being a master at something but not growing. In my experience In working In construction I learned how to measure wood, cut wood, and Install wood frames and all of that taught me how to be a more efficient person at my job. It also taught me how to use power tools and utilities and for me, I think it's better to know how to do different things like how to change the oil from your car or how to fix something that went wrong In your car like If something went wrong with your engine or If some hoses came loose. I believe If a person just want to know one thing and be great at It that's their right and that is acceptable, but they will be only focusing on one thing. But It's alright because not everyone would have the time or just wouldn't want to do It. So I think it great If someone has already mastered something that they really like doing, but I believe it's better to know many things like construction or car mechanic or how to connect electricity wires because I truly believe that knowing many things can give you more knowledge for the future.
