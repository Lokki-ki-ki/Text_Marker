It is a good idea for students to finish high school in three year and enter college or the work force one year early. The students will have an all year they can use. If they graduate one year early it would help they in college or after college, it would be helpful for them in their future job too. The students will be able to experience an early college, and they will be able to take their time to get everything they need for their life after college, it will also help some of them in the job they decide to do, they will have time to get more experience for their job. It will give them the time they need to get the diplomats or the degrees they need for the careers the will chose after college. For the one who will be working after high school, it would give them the time they need to get to know their future jobs better. Graduating in three year will help the students a lot, it may take a lot of effort, but it's a gift, and they will be the ones to get something out of it, that's why the students should be able to de everything they can to be successful in their early graduation program. They will have to take courses during the summers and probably in the evening, some may not be able to take elective courses, but it will help them a lot in their lives. I think that it's a good idea for students to finish high school in three years and enter college or the work force one year early, because it will be very helpful for them in their lives, it will give them the chance to experience college or work force a year early, and they will have one more year to prepare their future.
