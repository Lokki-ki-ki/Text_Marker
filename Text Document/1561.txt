The change can affect or can benefit, that means that sometimes we think that is good and bad, thinks that is bad and is good. An example of affect is when we buy a car, and This is look like beautiful for outside, but when a mechanical check inside discover that have much damage. An example of benefit is when somebody told you something bad of other person, and when you talk with that person you discover that is false.

All these can have influence when you change your impressions of someone or something. For example, when we are angry all is look like bad or annoying.
