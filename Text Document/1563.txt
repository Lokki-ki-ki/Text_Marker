Students will benefit from being able to do the classes from home because maybe they have reason to do there or having some problems because some people doesn't like the community or having to many people around them. If I have a choice to choose one of them I think I will choose to go to school to know more people. These are my three reasons on how students can do the online classes from their home. The first reason is why students want to do the online classes from their home, because maybe they don't like the people from outside probably they think that all people are bad, they are not nice, mean, in respectful. Probably their parents doesn't want because they scared of how people are going to treat them, or they are going to give them a bad influence like going in the wrong life. Or they don't want because her son/daughter are bad having some medical problems they think that the people are going to laugh at them. The second reason is maybe other students don't like to a normal day of school they probably like to stay at home and taking the online classes from there, because they feel that people are not going to like them or judging them sometime students don't want to go because maybe they have a medical problem because they feel embarrassed or something bad happened when they were at school.Finally, if I choose one of them like staying at home or going to school I will choose to go to school because I will love to help people to explain to them that why is important to go to school and giving advice to them that they don't need to be embarrassed if they have problems they just need you let it go some people don't think if he or she is hurting the person who is bullying them. In conclusion is that if people choose the online classes and doing at their home they are free to choose because they equal are going to study but at their home they have reason to do there. But I will say that people don't need to care what other people are saying to them.
