Students should not be able to graduate early. If students stay in school the extra year they have more opportunities. The fourth year of high school gives them more time to learn. It also gives them more time to explore different careers they might want to do. Students might be stressed out too much. It is better to take your time then to rush your career. Students who go the last year of high school have more time to learn more. They can take more classes than those who would graduate early. The classes will be easier because they will be learning at their grade level, not a grade level above. They also won't have as much homework and classwork to do at a time. The students will have more career choices to choose from. If they have more time they will be able to have electives that can help them choose their career. For example there is a nursing class, carpentry class, electricity class, welding class, and many more that can help them get started. If they can't take electives then they won't have experiences that may help them. Lots of work on a student can cause them to be stressed out. Some students already get stressed by the amount of work they get in regular classes. Imagine all the stress they get when they are taking more classes at a time. They can get stressed by all the homework and classwork they get from all their classes. They might also have a job they have to get to save money for their college supplies like textbooks. Which gives them less time to do their work and study.
