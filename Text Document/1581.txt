Ex: Generic_Name said, When she was young, to commit to a career was the best thing that put her in the best way, and believe her thing, when she believe her things, always she was in a good way, and it always protects her life, and many people get to respect her, because there are people who was not having a respect to her, and it's shows her what kind of something she has to do that can give her the way to reach her goal. Coulcaim:Many people said, Students should not have to commit to a career at a young age because it's not important in their life, it cannot help them anything at all. Therefore: to commit to a career can teaching students nothing in their life, they cannot trust or believe them work or what they are doing. Coclusion: To commit to a career in life makes students to understand many things, and if students trust them things they can get good safe in their life, they can teach others and protect their life, and students having to trust them things in lives, students cannot live without trust what they are doing and reach their goals.
