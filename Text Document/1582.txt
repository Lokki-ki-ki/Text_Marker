I agree with having an after school homework club, because It will help out a lot of students improve in school, and do better overall. Also don't you want extra help when you need it? Students are the same they want help on schoolwork and homework because it could be difficult. Students don't really like difficult homework, so they give up and do something else, but with a homework club they can go after school and do the work there teachers can help students out. For example I sometimes need help, so I have a teacher that helps me at home with my work and my parents has to pay that teacher. And some parents don't have the money to pay for a teacher, so if we can work together to make a club that helps out students that would be great for the students, and the parents would not have to pay a lot of money to make they child good at school.an other example would be that students can stay after school with their teachers, but for a bit of time, so if were going to have a homework club let's make it more than 47 minutes. More time equals a lot of work getting compled.in conclusion we need a homework club it can help out a lot of students and save a lot of points money, and also make students pass more tests and help that on schoolwork, and make students feel like difficult work is easy since they got all the help they need from the after school club, also if some teachers don't feel like staying for another they could just let the students help each other and let the teacher rest. Overall I think this idea is very good, and well help out a lot of students with there work.
