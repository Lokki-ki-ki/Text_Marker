Dear, PrincipalIn my opinion, I think that you should allow students to bring their phones to school, but with the condition, to use them outside their classes. Students need their phones for any emergencies. However, students are to understand that teachers don't want them to be disturbing the class. Also, I think that the students know better to turn off their phones, if they don't want their phones to be taken away. Students still bring their phones to school whether you teachers and principal don't allowed them to. So, I absolutely agree with the policy of letting students bring their phones
