My position about this prompt is that students should not take the program that allow students to graduate them in three years, because is not like taking normal classes, for example what would happen if students get to take the program that will allow them to graduate in 3 years? They would have to take more classes in less time:Because as I read in the prompt there was one part that says "for students in order to graduate must take summer courses", and this means that they would not have a break in this time. Not because of the time but for those students that would decide that they would not only risk felling some classes but also not to take elective classes during summer because that's what this prompt says. It will be more stressful:As we all know school sometimes can be stressful but imagine how stressful if for students that graduate in four years as every other normal programs that high schools offer, now imagine how it would, it be for students that take programs allowing them to graduate in three years. I'll say they have to work even harder, during the summer they have to take courses in order to be upgraded to the grade they are going to, also a lot of SOL's test will be taking in less time, I'm not saying that those people won't have enough time to study, but what I'm saying is they would have a really busy schedule with all their classes plus all of those tests coming up it won't be easy for them. The reason that why I used those examples to explain the main idea like this, it was for you to understand that such as that program it can be very difficult for students, not just that but for students that might not be quick to understand new subjects or new units, it can get them stuck in there with no option but to get into a point when they would just give it up and quit because it will get really hard for them. Now that I showed you how hard could it be for students that would take a three-year-high school program, now it clarifies that there's no need to rush with education and that students should take normal high school program because it wouldn't be so hard as taking the other program that I just talk about, in conclusion students have more changes to graduate with a four-year-program, as long as they keep themselves in track with what they are supposed to do it won't be no problem, and there will be less stress for them, more freedom to take a break when they need to, and enough time to study.
