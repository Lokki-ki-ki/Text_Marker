In my opinion setting a good example is the only way to influence people you're a good person. Many people won't believe you're a good person just because you say you are. However, if you show them by how you act like for an example: you don't bother anyone, you show where a location is or try to, being polite, patience, showing manners, etc. They will find you setting a good example or showing good behavior. Not only setting a good example can make people say you're a good person, it can also lead to "good karma".Let's say you have a younger sibling, and they want to be like you, you can be smart, responsible, and a good behaving person, show them a good example, so they can be as successful as you. Same goes to people don't show them a bad behavior or example, that's not going to get you anywhere, that'll only make people not like you and assume different things. Another thing is always set good example when you're out in public with a family member, because if you don't people will not like that and have your family at fault.in conclusion to all this if you show good behavior or set a good example by showing it, It will not only make people assume you're a good person it will also influence young ones to do the same.
