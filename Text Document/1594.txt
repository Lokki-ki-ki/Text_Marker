I agree that praising a students work is an outstanding idea to jump start a students' path to success, but praise is not the way to increase their self-esteem. By overpraising a student his or her confidence has to be on a different level. Students will also have a harder time dealing with constructive criticism. However, if a student works really hard to achieve something, then that feeling of completion can motivate them to continue to their path of success. Getting your business done without any praising and knowing you put your all into it could make you feel way better about yourself, and it would just not motivate you but the people around you. I say this because people don't usually thank you or give you any comments they usually mean. You would never know what could come out someone's mouth. They wouldn't want to agree with this but, that's because we all think different and most of us know the real meaning behind something similar to this. If you achieve something, and you keep on achieving things in life you will get many blessings. People don't usually know the difference between praising and achieving your goal without it. You don't need people telling you about your work or whatever you are doing because at the end of the day you're the only one who knows what you're accomplishing in life. Teachers should let students achieve their goals and not worry about what the other person has to do or say. By accomplishing something could make you learn new things in life too. People get confused and don't get the message, we need more people to believe in their selves and not about what other people have to say. Although I think it's nice of people complimenting and saying positive things about your work but, I still have to go with achieving it on your own. So what if they dislike your achievements? So what if they start doubting? Prove them wrong with all your accomplishments that are coming your way. Make them regret what they said and go accomplish more.
