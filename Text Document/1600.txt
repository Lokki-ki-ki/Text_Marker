"Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered you will never grow". Yes you will never grow because you will never have now experience, that will need in the feather I agree with author Ralph Emerson for three reasons. First, when you try a now thing you are going to have different name about a last of different thing. Scored, when you have different ideas you have different way of thinking. Third, when you try to see other people and how they act and Thar cooler you will now how to talk with this without disrespect this. Lastly, that why we showed always learn. Whan I try a now thing i always learn something now. For example, when I came to the U.S. I did not have EAFE name about what is in the U.S. so that was an issue ROR me learning the language i shall because did not go beyond what I have already mastered. Then, when i start to learn more about the language I start to go beyond my no leg. Arthur life is hared and learning is hared but some times when you learn a love you get a love .when you have different ideas you have different way of thinking. First, people code love to talk to you and now you. Scored, when you in school you will have a lot of ideas about what class to take. Third, Knowing a lot help your family tow. Finely that why having a lot of ideas help you. Whan you try to see how other people and how they act and how Thar cooler is you now how to talk with this thou disrespect this. First, when you line to people and how the talk you're going to learn e what cited of person he is and how to talk with this. Scored, you can chews the person that you are going to love from learning about how the sweaty work. Third, being nice to every one men you are going out and seeing other people. And, that what I agreed with the author Ralph Waldo Emerson because going beyond what you have already mastered is laying.
