My thought on the prompt are that I think it's better to be active. Being active or doing something all the time is good. You can be very helpful by helping people out or doing chores. Doing something all the time can make you physically fit. You can be moving all the time and a lot it can be good exercise. I like working out or helping people out especially my family. Many people enjoy or like to be active, and it makes them feel good including myself. I can'not stay inactive for a long period of time like many people in this world. In some people's life activity play's a major role in there life's. Like a personal trainer or a coach. Inactivity is sometimes bad especially if you do it for a long time. It can be frustrating to other people if everybody is working but you and they need your assistance. If I am inactive for a long period of time I can get sick or really anybody if you have been lying around doing nothing for days. Your body needs movement or some type of exercise. That's why it's better to be active. Therefore, inactivity can sometimes be good or necessary. For example, if you are watching a movie at the movie theater. You can'not be jumping and running all over the place you are going to get kicked out. In some situations when something bad is happening outside your home is better to stay as far away as you can and do'not intervene is better to stay idle. Finally, I some occasions is inactivity serves a purpose. You do accomplish more if you stay active, and you can beat your goals in life if you put hard work and not staying idle.
