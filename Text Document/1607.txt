The greats benefit to work with a group work on groups is better for many reasons, everybody can help each others, in groups student's can do a better work, and it can help all the people on the group to learn more skills, it can help students to know each others and be friends, more communications, more ideas, and sometimes it can be helpful to work in groups because some students don't know what to do, i think teachers should let student's to work more on groups so like that they would help each other and work better, and is good to work with a group because that can help you for the rest of your life like on your job also with your family, and you con do better and a great job if you work in groupie can be helpful for students to work in group, First, because with more people helping are more and betters ideas and more helpful for every student, and sometimes student's don't know what to do, but if somebody on the group help, so he would understand and know how to do a great job and work with a group is much helpful than work alone on many ways like to understand better with communication with your group, and it can be helpful, so you can do a good work and pass the class and not failed, and work in group it can help you to know others people that are in the same classroom, but you never have the opportunity to talk with their so in the teacher make a group, and you can going to one there is going to be new people, and you can know others people, Second,it is good for student's to work in groups because they can learn more skills such like the communication, and they can help each others with the written, and also they can help each others how the way they talk. The communication is important and many cases because with communication you can do many things, like if you don't understand something you can tell somebody for help and all the persons on the groups can practice all days to do a great work, and also some student's need a lot of help so students that know more can join to the groups to help the others, but sometimes is not because some students don't know how to do the work sometimes it because they don't understand sometimes is because the language is a problem for some students so there is good to make groups to help them, Third it can be an experience to work in groups because some students that don't know each others later on they can be friends and work in groups it can be helpful to students, but also to school because work on groups students can understand more, and they can get betters grades also work in groups and a good relationship it can be helpful not only at the school it can be helpful like in your home with the family and not to get in trouble with their, but also it can help you on your job to work well and not to have problems with the people that you work with, is like on soccer that why it calls a soccer team because they help each others they share new or more strategies that it can help others to do a great job because work in groups students have more and betters benefits to do a great job, Finally is good to have a good communication in groups because with a great communication all the group can understand each others and is important to have a good relationship in the group so like that they can do a better job and some students help others and that is great to be generous with others because if you help to someone that need to help other people is going to help you on what you need and is a lot much better to work in group than alone sometimes when you are working alone, and you got stuck in something nobody is going to help you, but if you are working with more people in group they're going to help you on what you need but most of the teachers want's to students work alone sometimes is good that students work alone because sometimes students got distracted for the people on the group and the teachers don't want students to copy all others sometimes is good to work alone maybe better concentration, but sometimes is not that good to work alone because sometimes you got stuck in something, but if you are working with a group they are going to help you I would like to see more teachers that put more students to work in group I don't think students would like to work alone than with a group is better a sometimes is more easy and faster In conclusion, is a great idea for me that's teachers make students to work in groups on my opinion is much helpful to they work in groups instead to work alone, because when people work in groups they have betters ideas, and they can do a better work with more interesting and more opinions is better to do a great job and also have a great relationship and a great communication is so important to work in a group and some students know more than others so the students that's know more is good that they help the others on what they need and is good to work in group so like that you can know others people I hope teachers continuing making groups to students can learn more than what they know and work in group it can help you on your life because if you got a job and many people work there too, but you don't like to work with others people as a group the boss is going to kick you out only because you don't know how to work as a group and if you only like to work alone it can be a problem if you don't understand work with others people is better always more ideas, opinions like that you can do a better work, and it can help your future job and the rest of your life sometimes some students don't like to work in group's sometimes it because they don't know others people, but i think if teachers would like to student's work more in groups i think they would like it, and they can have more communication student's would like to work with a group, I like to work with a group because sometimes I don't know what to do so others students help me to do a great work, and we all share other.
