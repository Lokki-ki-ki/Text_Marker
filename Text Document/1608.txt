It's a fact that positive altitude is the key of success. In every single things that you made, or every single act that you take, even a small ANE like blink if you are not confident in what you are doing, on that I will make it falling, you will be failing. That does not mean that dealing is a bad thing because dealing is an important aspect of successes. Not only because you will learn from the mistakes that led you to the failing box. But also you will come back knowing against what you are fighting with, next time you will be back with a different set of mind, with a different plan, even with a different altitude, and all that because one thing with all the people says is bad.'' Fail''.but let's be honest, why would somebody fail if you have the chance to be successful ?, because if you are not going to win and get what you want and are looking for, do not even struggle, stay at home laying down and watching some series. There is a real hungry world with real hungry people out there and if you are just giving the 75 percent it of your capacity it would be just not enough.That's were positive altitude comes up, if you know your value, and you are whaling to give the one hundred percent you don't have to worry. If you are confident and positive you will go for what you are looking FOF do not matter who is against you, do not matter what the people would say, and specially it does not matter the cost of it. That is the key of success.
