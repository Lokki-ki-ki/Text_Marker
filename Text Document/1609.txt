Thomas Jefferson wrote "Determine never to be idle" that is mean like some time we are busy. I agree with this prompt because it's something possible and if we're always doing something. In my opinion we accomplish more if we are always doing something because sometimes we have stuff to do for example going to work after school or study after school. But some time people they don't like to do school work for the reason they think there are not smart. In my position do work it's some I like to do every day because that's how I learn more stuff. IF we have a park time after school that is something good because you are receiving money for your self, and maybe you can help your parent with bills. Some peoples think that if we don't do something in this life we can have a better responsible. That is mean if we don't work or study for a better life them we are not going to have nothing for. Exaplem if you are18 or more you have to look for a job became you are responsible for your self because your parents there are not going to give you anything what you want you have to work and buy your own stuff. This is something possible we can do in us life. Some may say that to do nothing is better life. They said that because they never think about the future, or maybe they don't want to do nothing in the life and that is not going to work. For example I have a lot of stuff to do for graduate from high school I have to pass my ESOL and have a good great grade if I don't graduate from high school that choice I have is to work outside. However, if a want the opportituti to do something in the future the best choice is to study effort my self and go to the college to have a better job. People Sometimes they're busy in keys that is something possible in us life because we want to become a good person and responsible in the future that's that way we learn it is easy to do something never give up.
