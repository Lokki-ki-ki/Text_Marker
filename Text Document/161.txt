Its success consists of going from failure? I think that there are people that are successful and have gone through failure because without experiences people will not know that is out there. I believe that in live there is going to be up and down and this teach us who to be a successful person. First, to have a successful live we need the experience to be success not matter who many obstacles we have. When I was eleven I star making cookies at first I was bad, and when I fail the first try, but I keep going to make cookies not matter how bad I was. Then as I keep failing, and one day I was able to be successful. People have to know that we are not perfect and in some point of live we have to be unsuccessful to became what we want to be some day, Also is very important that people have the capability to say that they have make mistake. Second, people have up and downs. As an example J. K Rowling she wrote the Harry Potter sires, and she wants it to publish, but she was not successful, and then by the time her sires was one of the most famous book. I believe that anyone can be a successful person, but they have to know that not every thing is going to be a success at the first try.Others believe that success is not consisted in failure because they think that people can be successful without making any mistake. Thinking that every thing is easy as a litter kids puzzle. In conclusion failure is one step of been success because every person can process the piece that their missing to be successful. As people have been going in up and down, and had experiences who is a thing are going.
