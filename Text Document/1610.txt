I disagree with the principal saying that all kids should at least join one extracurricular activity because kids have other things to do like homework, they might be already doing an activity, and they'll get tired faster if the principal make them do an other activity, and it can contain stress if you don't get it right the first time. For and foremost, I disagree with the principal saying that all kids should at least join one extracurricular activity because the student have homework to do, and I know that I get a lot of homework maybe you do too I also know teachers give kids projects and if the principal makes them do an extra activity then they won't be able to have anytime to do their own things. Also, studies have shown that making kids do an extra activity can contain a lot of stress and who wants to be stressing I know I don't, and it can also contain kids losing sleep do to the activities if they have homework and an activity to do it'll make the students lose sleep due to the activity and the brain needs a good hour of sleep for it to function well. This is why I say principals shouldn't make students join activiesSecondly, I disagree with the principal because the students will get way more tired faster and did you know that someone in Washington DC, fainted due to the principal making the student do an other activity and that's why the principals shouldn't make students join an other activity because it'll most likely make them get tired faster and what we want is to keep our kids healthy, but we can't keep them healthy if the principal makes them join an activity. Lastly, my last reason is stress, stress can come from a lot of things like work, school,friends, parents,children as you see stress comes from a lot and school stress is a big OE because we all know sometimes our grades go down and when we try to bring them up it gets really stressful and especially if your principal is making you do an other activity that'll make even more stress and multiple studies have shown that a lot of the stress that kids get is from school and other actives. Those were all of my reason on why the principal shouldn't make students join an other activity especially if they don't want to. Overall, I disagree with the principal making students do an other activity because of homework, losing sleep faster and last but not least is stress. Those were all of my reasons on why the principal shouldn't made students do an other activity
