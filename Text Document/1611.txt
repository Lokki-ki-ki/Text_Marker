Kids play to have different jobs, but I know, since I was a baby, what I want to do. The world of the entertainment, in special the theater, is something that always catch my attention, that's why I would like to visit the Art and Performance Center. The principal reason why I want to go is for my family influences, my grandma has been dreaming about me been an actress. I remember going to the theater with her, telling me that her biggest dream is, one day, see me on one of those performances or shows. When I was littler, I used to participate on local shows every summer, her proud smile and happy tears make me feel that I was on the right place, doing the right thing. I know she would be so happy if I become an actress. Also, the Art and Performance Center has been the place of one of my favorites presentations,"The Rose", the feelings that the Estonians transmit during the hold act are powerful; they make you feel that you are part o the show, or even better, they make you feel that is not a show. Imagine myself on that scenario with the lights, music, the public, while I am realizing a magnificent performance is something that makes my feel really grate. I want to inspire people in the same way that actors inspires me. My love for the performant arts isn't the unique reason why I should go, I am a respectful and courteous person; a hard worker which goal is to learn everything about arts. Some students aren't really interested on the place they go, playing around, acting boring, but not me, I am really interested in this opportunity, in all the special details of the world of preforming arts. From the backstage to the actual scenario, everything would be a deceitful experience for me. For all this reasons, I would like to go to the Art and Performance Center, seeing all the components and experiences that brings you the fantastic world of the theater.
