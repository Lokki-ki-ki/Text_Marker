I believe that schools should allow the students to graduate in traditional four years, instead of three years because If some student field the class or the SOL, they should a time to retake those classes they field. Most of the students don't what to take a course during the summers. Some students want to take an elective courses in schools not in summers has as an art, moose, and language they want. I personify believe students graduate in four years because they will have time to retake a class or SOL if they need to do. I think its head for some student to work and graduate in three years instead of four years. The most immoral think is that if the students field a class they can't graduate the high schools before they pass the class they field. Most of the student's don't want to take a course during the summer because they want to have free time, they don't want to work on summers. Some students work and save some money for college. They don't want to work for schools on summers. They're some family who love traveling with their kids. Most of the students want to take an elective courses but not in summer. Houses what want to take is art, moose, and language they want. Some of the classes that students take as an elective course can help them in college or in work force. Some elective course that students take can help them find out what they like or dislike. Overall my position on this issue is that schools should offer four years high schools, instead of three years because it's can hope students to get ready for college and work.
