In some Societies, students are expecting to identify a career by the time they enter to high school, Their courses of study in high school are selected to guide them toward a specific careers and take the classes they need for the career to practices more and be more specific in the career and have more thinks to know how it works for them, in some career they need a lot of think to try it, and they need practice to be in high level of the career and at young age they are expecting what career they want to take when they get older and get to high school. I think that's good idea for students to commit to a career at young age, because some careers are really hard to take it and if they start talking about what career they can take from young age, they would know more about how the career work, and before they get to high school some of them would know what kinda of classes they can take and how it works to get better practice in the career because some careers are really hard to take it, but some are not that hard to take it, but in high school they are many classes about careers, and they talk about it, and it works. When they get to high school, they can ask what are better courses for this career and what is better for this career and get information. When they are younger they are thinking in many careers, and they talk to the teacher what's better in this career and what kinda classes they can help and bring up better in the career, When they get to high school the thinking in many more career and getting more ideas about careers and see which one is better and talk about it. And when they get age when they have take classes for the career they're getting more ideas about the career. By the time of the classes they meet someone who knows the about careers, and they ask what they need for take classes, and visit the college or make a field trip and meet with the company of the career, before they get to high school, they're trying to be better in every class they have and have good grades and take important classes that work for the career and trying to take everything what they need for the career and important thinks learning everything. Most students from young age are thinking in career, when they start middle school are thought what kinda of career they can take when they get to high school, and when they get to high school they are looking for the classes about their career, and see what can they do to learn more about what they think in their career and see how can they do to take it, and do the best with their classes to complete the career for their job and take about what they need for the college. I think that's a good idea to be thinking from young age, so when they get to high school they already know what career they going to take and what kinda classes they work for their career and be prepared for collage, and from younger age they are learning more about what they want to be when they get older, When they get to their college they would have more experience with their career, because they start thinking from young, and they take course that help for their dreams with the career.
