People who do not have patient cannot make an experience without helping from someone else, and a project is not hard to make, but you have to think about what you are going to say in the project. There are a lot of way you should find to do something, and even if you would not understand what you are doing. Don't give up, because one day you will realize your dream. For this subject I do not agree with it, because if you're making mistake often that doesn't mean you will never grow up. Sometimes you have to force yourself to work, and in life you need to keep moving on, in what you're doing, you have to make sure that you never go back in the past, because you would like to realize your dream that you promised yourself in the future. For this position you may say that if you are trying to do something, and you already know that it is not going to be right, just leave it until you find the right way to do it. If you have an experience to do something, and prove it you need to think about it first, before you try your best in what you were trying to do. You could have done something that you had to do. You have to check it, so to make sure it is good or not good, so that is the way you can learn from your mistakes. Most of the time, you feel like you cannot do anything all you can do is just sleeping that does not mean you will never grow. You will grow in a good situation, if you are always doing good things, and you never do something wrong. Now you will be growing up, and people will appreciate you everywhere you go to. For example, you have already done some stuff that you are not supposed to do, life is going on that does not mean you will never grow. If you already have a plan to do something you need to think about it, before you start doing it. In life, you suppose to have done the right things to continue with the others.
