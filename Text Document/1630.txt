If I had to take a side I think I would disagree. One reason is that you can't always have success, there are times where something's don't work out. Then there's failure and that's how you have success in anything from learning from your failure But there is time when when you fail and your enthusiasm is gone because of that. The one reason I agree is that there's time that you just can't have success. I have had that in my life in many situations. Once when I was playing soccer we had won all the games and then came to the day when we were playing for first place, and we lost and that day all my enthusiasm was gone. I was so mad and just had no energy. I learned that there times that I won't win and times I will, it's part of life but along the way I learn new things. Then there school there you do go from failure to success because once you make a mistake, and you learn from it and do better next time because your already know now, but it does bring your enthusiasm down. The next reason is that failure does make you have success, but also it makes not encourage keeping going. From the first time you fail to the next will learn something and later on when it happens again that's will you will get it. When you do fail and fail you lose enthusiasm but gain it back when you have success. You feel sad and mad and just not excited any more when you keep failing again and again. So when you fail and fail again you will away lose enthusiasm because you just can't get it. So if I had to pick a side I would disagree because you can't just fail and fail and then have success and not lose enthusiasm. And I disagree from experience because in my life I fail and never still had enthusiasm after failing maybe some people do, but I speak from my point of view.
