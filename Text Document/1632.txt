One way to improve student achievement is to start an after school homework club. Teachers and students should start meeting after school this idea would benefit students by getting extra support, turning assignments on time get a better understanding of the things that the teacher teach on class, establishing the club would help those students who don't turn in assignments on time or those who like to do things early. In order to students to be successful they need extra support a better explanation of the things they learn, many students struggle with the assignments and most of them don't ask for support through the school year I have seen many students raping the assignments because they don't understand them, but if the school make the idea of starting a club there would be no excuse for students to not be successful in their homework, tests, and class assignments. Students should start turning assignments on time specially those who don't turn in on time, the club would help many students like instead of going home and forgot that they have assignments to do they could come and join the after school homework club. I have friends who like to do homework and be successful, but the problem is that they don't understand the assignments and if someone doesn't understand something why should they do it because either way they're going to get the assignment wrong the school must provide more support for students. In addition, the club could not be just of getting help or finish assignments early, the club could be a place were students can find support and motivation in order to be a better person on life many students don't care about school because they don't find the good thing about it maybe because they need a motivation to be at school the after school club could be a place where people can meet and share ideas or meet each other and make a friendship helping each other to understand better the thing that they don't understand. In conclusion the school must make the after school club in order to get more successful students and to also help and motivate students to do their assignments and turning them on time. Extra support is a better way to understand the things you don't understand, turning assignments make a student seem responsible and also get a good admiration of others making friends and share, discuss thing together is a better way to solve a problem that they had.
