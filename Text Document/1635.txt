Where would I want to go list? I would want to go to list El Salvador because I want to go list my family. Also, I would want to go the beach. Then I would love to eat their food that they have one reason I want to go to El Salvador, I want to go list my family because I have not seen them in 6 years and I really want to spend time with them. Also, I would want to spend with my baby cousin. The reason I would spend time with him is that he's a very special kid, and he's very sick I would do many things for him. After I spend time with him, I would take my family for dinner, and they would be happy that I took them out to eat. My second reason is I would want to go to the beach because I want to see how beautiful it is over there. Also, many people say it's beautiful because of the ocean. Then I would want to go to swim! Many people say that the water is very warm because it's closer to the equator, it's not like the US the water is cold. Then after swimming I want to buy a neckless for everyone in my family. My third reason is I would want to try their food that they have because people say it's amazing. I want to try their proposal because it's better than the stores. The way you they make it, is they start with corn mass, then they make a mini bowl, then you can put cheese and beans whatever you want, then you close it you put it in the pan and let it cook. The best thing about proposal when they're over fill when the cheese and beans are dripping. These are my reason where would I go to list. We should list many places because we can learn something new. Also, we should try are best to go somewhere at least the cheap strip you can find. Maybe I would be able to go to El Salvador.
