I think students should not be required to take an arts class. Students have the rights to take the classes they want to take. If they like arts classes they are free to take that class. But students that don't like art class do not have to take the class. For example I really don't like arts classes but I'll still take the class because at my school they do this thing that if we need to retake a curse class then we will have 25% of taking that class or if we don't need a curse class we had the 50% of taking that. It might be the same in some schools, or it might be different it others schools. Some kids may not like the idea of taking art classes and some may like the idea. Kds may want to have space to take the class they want, and they can't because they are required to take arts class. Like they want to take gym or something like this but I know that some boys would not like this idea. If some kids do enjoy painting or acting. But some kids do not like acting or painting. They might think that it's boring for them to be in that class. I know that some kids like to act cool and be rude to teachers that they don't like the class or something like this. That's why I'm saying that arts classes should not be required to take. I think the best thing to do is to allow kids to pick their classes that they want to take as an elective class .it's really the best thing to do in my thinking. Because look at it like this if kids that don't like drama, and they don't let the teachers teach because they do not want to be there. They want to be in another class that they really want to be. That's another thing that teachers have to go through dealing with rude kids. This concludes my argument about students having to take arts classes. This is for all schools please let your kids pick their classes. Or at least give them one class that they like. Like I said at first I really don't like this argument that's happening.
