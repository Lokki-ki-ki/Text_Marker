I agree with Emerson's restatement, in my point of view or personality I can say that I want to be a different person with another qualities, create other ways to think how big or how much I can do to show to the world my authentic and proper knowledge, when I have to make a decision I don't have to think too much about it, I believe in what I'm doing. When you think to be a real person and someone different to the rest, you need to have a plan that consist step by step and develop that plan in the course of your life to make goals to short time and large period of time, be patient with each little detail that you want to do. For example:If to want to do something that you think that is impossible for any reason, you don't have to leave that idea or goal that you have in mind, remember that all you need is work hard, be simple and don't complain about any problem or reason that tomorrow will have a lot of consequences. At this time, the people and no one wants to see another person having their own goals or their dreams that they had when they were children. Every single person will try to impress to your attention to turn down your attitude and your positive life, I have too many experiences that I never want to pass that process again, in this world exist all type of people that want to help, to destroy your intention or the ways to see the real things, you're a guide and an example to change the format in this age. When you have a purpose that everyday make changes in your personal life or something like motivation to do anything that have a great value to demonstrate to you family that they are the base to all of your goals have worth. A big percentage of people want to be rich, and my way to think about it, is that all thing that's material it doesn't have a real value for a great and humble person, the value is something that makes you have a great family, a simple life, because the world need to be protected by several and carefully people that are interested in show another face to represent a different type of humanity. Be an individual person is how you can to do to confront the reality and give another perspective to make a great research in your period of life to change or keep using that type of life and really cares about what are you doing with a specific and central idea. I have a positive and big action to say that Emerson is right because nobody wants to be the shadow of any person or leave an opportunity that will make the life of one or more person to decide to experiment a new way to see the society and doing the correct process to be an excellent human with integrity and feeling of better life. My conclusion for this restatement is that I want to be myself with great intentions to form an integrity in this society and have the best recognition to prove that it's possible to make and develop a proper identity with a new perspective to imagine and be the next person in the world that makes you a connection with your interior and have peace to concentrate in own goals that will convert on a genuine person to be autonomous of your acts, be someone responsible, charismatic and all of these characteristics define your personality it doesn't matter where to come from or where you at, just be an example that if I can do this, you can do it better than me and better as you want.
