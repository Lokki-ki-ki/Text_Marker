There are many that have responsibility in the world that we have to do and with this responsibility there will be many challenges that we as humans have to overcome to these things in one way or another. A city council is debating adoption of a 10P. M. weekday curfew and a midnight curfew for teenagers. Dear city council I find it amazing that you are doing this, but I also do disagree mainly because. For example, we teenagers have to some activities after school, or we have jobs and if it's not because of those things It's because were stuck in traffic. I do understand the reasoning of why we shouldn't be driving at these hours of the night It's mainly because we're exhausted at that point we can't focus that much. To say something we teenagers we can stay awake much longer than you adults why do you think we stay up for so long it's not because we're bored no because we want you to see that we can hold our own wait, and we stay up for our jobs and don't sleep until we go home when we get home because in truth we can hold ourselves now. Dear to the city council I actually do think we should have teenagers off the road before 12AM. For example, that's when people that are under the influence are mainly on the road and depending on where you are there could be deer. There are lots of dangerous things in the night that no one can see or even some dangerous people that might harm us in the night. There are a lot of bad things on the road at night and you as the driver could of course from your long drive a turn tired and maybe crash. In conclusion, I see why you don't want us to go driving at 10PM or even past midnight because of there being dangerous things in the night, but I do also hope that you know that we don't stay up because of random things, but we're actually staying up important things like our jobs or after school activities and that we will be very careful in the night because we know of the dangers of the night.
