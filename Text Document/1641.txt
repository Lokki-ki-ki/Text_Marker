There are some schools that offer 3 years to graduate, but then there are some schools that are still doing Traditional way's of the 4 years of high school and in my opinion is that it is good to graduate early and go to college or the work force, but it also depends on the person that's doing all this work to graduate high school or the evenings or night school, but people still do it and it's good. The people that are doing all this work are hardworking people who want to follow through with their ideas and dreams in life, and they are paying good for it by studying and working hard throughout high school, and they keep on working hard to reach for there goal outside high school. In my opinion It's a great idea to finish all high school within 3 years because that's hard work paid off, but some people believe that if you stay in school for an extra year that makes you smarter but in some sense that could be true but sometimes people stay the extra year because for 1 they sometime's stay because they fell behind, and sometimes it's because they need one type of class for college but in reality the people who did the 3 years of high school are the truly advanced one's because they did everything within 3 years and it's good for them. If these people go into the work place they have a higher chance of getting the job that they want because they have a high school diploma and the fact that they graduated from school early so they that as an advantage for them when they find a job and most jobs are only looking for people that are either in high school or have a diploma because some job's just want people with brains so they could work smarter and not harder, but the truth is these people are doing everything to make a living because they worked really hard in high school now they're working really hard at a job, and now they are succeeding in life because they were smart and graduated earlier than everyone else In the case that going to college after graduating the three years are also good because they want to get into a field of a type of job that they wanted, and now they're working even harder for it but in reality its working smarter not harder because they are studying for a career that will give them more money no matter what because they are studying for 4 more years to achieve there dream of becoming something in this world, and they are smarter by doing that because a dream job is one of the thing's everyone wants and It's good to have a goal in mind. In my conclusion is that going to college is the better one because It's working smarter not harder and that's the better idea instead of working hard and not being able to get paid enough like the people at the college do so in my state of fact that college if the better choice to go without of high school no matter if you did 3 years or traditional 4 years of high school the best choice is after high school to go to a college or a university that makes life better in the end for everyone. Some people like to choose the route of hard work but it's perfect to head to a college or university after school is over for this person.
