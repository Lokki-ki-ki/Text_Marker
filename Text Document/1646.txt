School districts should allow students to graduate one year early but only if they took the courses. If the students willing to sacrifice their time, elective course, and really work to get to their goal of graduating a year early then they deserve it. From the process it takes to graduate a year before it would seem that yes, they are attending school for less time but from the courses in summer or evening they're putting the same if not little change in time of the average high school student in just that one year. If they can handle the equivalent of junior and senior year in the same year then it shows how hardworking and out going they are and could benefit them when they're choosing a collage because:it could impress the collages they'd want to attend they already know the stress of a collage class because of the extra courses they could be in a better position with organization, and being on time It would also be a great benefit for students who'd join the work force instead of collage because:they also know the stress from the extra courses if their family is going through financial problems it gives them more time to work they'd have a head start on their lifetime only real problem of this would be the amount of time and stress the student had but that's only limited for the school year.in conclusion I believe school districts should give students the chance to graduate early if they are willing to put the time and effort of two years into one and face the obstacles that come with it. Itd be very beneficial to the student and/or their family and create a great layout for them for what ever comes next.
