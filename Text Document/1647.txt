Aesop said, No act of kindness,"no matter how small is ever wasted" I think that what there trying to say is that no matter how mad you are or sad you can still find happiness or hope even if you lost someone in a family member it is ad but also just be a little happy that he is in a better place that he does not have through any pain or suffering. Aesop said, No act of kindness,"no matter how small is ever wasted". I think he is also trying to say is that don't let anyone drag you down do what you think is right and don't let anyone tell you that your wrong try to prove them wrong because you can do anything. Maybe you can be wrong but learn from your mistakes and try again. Aesop said, No act of kindness,"no matter how small is ever wasted". I think what he is also trying to say is to be happy to have fun enjoy the little thing's as a kid once you become older you're not going to have that much fun because were going to have to find a job, house, vehicle, and other stuff, and it's not going to be fun so enjoy the little things and to have fun while you can.
