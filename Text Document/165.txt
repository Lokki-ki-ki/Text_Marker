In this world It's hard to be yourself everyone wants to do the same thing. Still being yourself in this world is the greatest accomplishment. A lot of people judge in this world telling people what's good and what's bad for this it's hard to be yourself in a world like this. People with social media will change people and being in high school with people around you will judge and follow the trend of the world. Social media is like a book of rules everyone wants to follow and act the same. Popular apps like Instagram people post things about their life and how they're doing good and looking great with a trending outfit. People see this post and do the same thing and act different knowing that this is not you. For this you want to follow and do the same thing and change your way of living and yourself. Being yourself in high school is an accomplishment, someone will always judge and make you feel down. For this people change their personality and there way of life .like me, I was scared to talk to new people because I thought they will make fun of me, but that was not true and for that I am always acting like my self.It's the way of high school and if you beat the judgment and still be yourself it's an accomplishment in life. In conclusion being yourself in this world that is constantly trying to change you is an accomplishment. A lot of people change because of social media and high school. I agree its accomplishment because you beat the judgment and the fear of not being yourself in this world.
