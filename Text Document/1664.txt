I agree that imagination is more important than knowledge because when you imagine of doing something very important, like for example; you want to be successful in school education to become like a doctor, teacher, artist, or scientist. Anyone in the world can be a smart and better person by working on a job to study about objects, study about computers like the use of technology and the learning of cybersecurity, and to visualize and gain your experiences on working in any job you want work on by putting effort and using your brain. For example, you can imagine of becoming a scientist to learn about science, like chemicals, plants, experiments, and understanding more information about science and other objects by experiencing things. Like the more you imagine about things you experience through your job, the less knowledge you have to learn about something that haven't existed in the ability of inventing something creative that is very useful and better than anything. All you have to do is believe in yourself and use your imagination like to decide whether invent something particular than the other like building a house, a long bridge, and create like a watch to study about anything and learn more about it, you can invent, create, study anything by using your imagination by experiencing more about things you want to do when you grow up by using your brain, and knowledge to put more effort into jobs. You can also invent instruments, like an accordion, violin, guitar, and a piano, and you can imagine anything like cool stuff, like being an expert at teaching in school like a teacher, studying science, being a doctor, a builder to invent or build stuff like buildings, or a manager who is in charge of training any team or an athlete for the next match, by having the ability to use your imagination. We all know that using your imagination is a better thing to do than using knowledge, like imagining to build, invent, or do anything in your experience by learning more information, support, and details about using imagination of doing anything.
