Technology has a good and bad effects, it allows us complete task without having contact with others. Also, just makes things so much easier for us. Technology developed over time so quickly, I remember, I used to have a flip phone but, now there is iPhone X. No buttons at all and the face ID. Much as the technology developed the people will be separated from each other. Tesla just introduced Tesla Model X. It has an autopilot mode. Self-driven car. Also, they announced they're making tunnel just for the autopilot mode. Elon Musk says "its much cheaper than the normal tunnel and safer". And he mentions on his tweeter "Working on something","flying car picture". So he is already working on the new tech. It's only 2019, can you imagine how technologies would be in next 10 years?. It will be keep developing and developing. Furthermore, it won't stop. We will get to some point, we don't even have to see each other or talk to each other.Nowadays, kids don't play outside, they have their iPad, Xbox and PC. Even the babies got iPad. If you give the baby iPad, the babies would be distracting themselves. It's much easier for the moms too. But some point kinds get addicted to it. Crying and sometimes they just won't eat anything. Smartphones can be really dangerous to the eyes. Technologies can be helpful but, it can cause negative effects.
