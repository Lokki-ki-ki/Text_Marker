In my opinion do we accomplish is if we are doing something because if you are always doing something you can have what you want, and you can always keep learning new things. First, if you are always doing something you can have what you want you. For example, if you want to buy the car of your dreams, you want a big house is gonna cost too much money but if you have a good job and you're doing well in what you do, you can have a car if you want or a house however if you do not want to accomplish you never going to have something. So, you need to always doing something if you want to accomplish. Second, you can keep learning new things in life, in the school if you still are in there and even in your job. For example in your job if you are new you need to learn how you gonna your own work and if you do to want to learn you never going to be good in what you're doing or in the school, when I start go to the High School I was scared because I don't speak English, but I started to doing something, and now I speak is not the better English but is work. In conclusion, we accomplish more if we are always doing something because if you are always doing something you can have what you want, and you can always keep learning new things.
