I agree with the adoption about the midnight weekend however this did not mean that I agree the 10 p. m weekday curfew. Although many of the teenagers are constantly restricted nevertheless, the teenagers more younger's that 18 has their ownâ€™s responsibilities and obligations to themselves and for their families because, the teenager's need education, a home and money. The teenager's need education, being from elementary until high school grades. In 5 or 10 years in the future the teenager been the support from the economy, the country and the next generation. A home the teenager's need a place to call "home" that place where him not only can relax, rather he should be tranquil and save from the rest of the world; that place where you know that someone is too waiting for you with a smile and food, sure will be you should reprimand, but you know that is for your well-being and future. Logically the money is the more important fact in the teenagers' life, to won it is necessary to get a part-time job or work in the weekend, that is where is the problem to obtain money the teenager's from 16 to 18 year's has to use their value time after school to work. The part-times are approximate 6 hours; if a student work from 4. Pm to 9p. M there is no problem, but if a student work between the curfew from 5p. M to 10p. M the big problem is that the teenagers will be accused be breaking the law when it did not happen is just an unfairly interference from the city. In summary: The children's from today will be the (teenager) of tomorrow and the adults from the new generation.a home is the best place to a teenager to feel comfortable, save and tranquil. The money is the most important think for a teenager in the present and for their future and the time is a necessary value to get it.
