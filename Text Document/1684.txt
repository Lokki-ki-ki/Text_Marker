The minister Winston Churchill, he says that success in life or another things, there's a failure and don't lose enthusiasm because of that little things or because you fail one time in your try. I agree with the minister Churchill say because success it's a way to improve your skills or be better in what you did, and you try to not haves more make mistakes anymore, success can have failure, but also you can learn for them, and learn how to resolve your pronlemsand see how far you can go by trying, how you can have more experience by trading and trading again and again, no making mistakes anymore so the next time you don't have the same mistakes or problems because you learn about it. I think with success you can learn a lot of experience in your life, because with your failure you learn about it, because if you leave it like that you're not trying, and you are not exploring your self, so if you exploit your self you can see how far you can go to resolve the problems or the mistake you have. So if you explode your self trying more and more you can maybe resolve the problem or see how far you can go to find a solution, the thing is if you keep trying your best in something you don't know exactly what it is or how to resolve it in many times you can find a solution and fix it. Failure is not you are not going to resolve it because if you are doing your best, but you keep failure is because you need to find the problem you are not seeing, to resolve it failure is not because is not working success is because you didn't find the solution at your problem. For my conclusion for success you have to pass for a lot of problems and mistakes, so you can find a solution for it, in your life if you don't exp low your self you won't know what was the problem to that but if you exp low your self you can find the solution and also learn from that, trying hard and hard most of the times you can find a solution for everything and that is how you also you can help others with they problems like when they say two heads is better than one.
