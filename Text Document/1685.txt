I'm disagree with extending the school day, because we pass the half off the day in the school and the people won't like that because they want to have time on the rest of the day and do what they like to do. That is why I disagree with extending the day of school because we are not going to be able to do what we want to do on the day, If the school add more hours to the school is not going to be good because will be sad because they can't do what they want to do on the rest of the day. They will be mad at the school because the school will and late and don't have time to do anything because is we get out late of the school and the time that we get home is parent won't let us have fun, and they will send us to bed. That is why the people won't like an extra hour of school because we are not going to give fun and we won't be able to do anything about sport. So that is why we don't what to have extra time of school because it can be boring because we only do homework, and we don't go an outside we don't like extra time in the school.
