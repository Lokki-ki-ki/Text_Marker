Former British Prime Minister Winston once said that "success consists of going from failure without loss of enthusiasm and basically its asking me if I agree on it. Basically I really have never heard about this prompt but I find it really interesting and would love to know more about it, I feel like if there were to ask me an public place for example now but instead a public place and read about it more and even just reading a little about it makes me agree on it. In my opinion I would definitely agree on it since what he said was pretty true, he basically said something that is basically true and not only that its basically making you think that it is right that "success consists on many things but for sure loss of enthusiasm"which is not wrong now I feel like I've thought about it just couple minutes and its making me think a lot about it specially how much I've failed and life and always got up back like nothing was wrong. May not be true for many people but for sure for me, I would agree on it 100% without doughting it at all, it's always the ones that have failed and gotten up who would agree on it, it could be tough for many to accept it, but eventually they would agree to it if they were to think about how many times they have failed and won there battled with fighting for it and doing basically what they really want in their life. All you have to do to get through things are got stronger and work on yourself more, feel valued to your surroundings. However, I have failed so many times and always thought about how i wouldn't make it not even how hard I try to i wasn't going to make it out of the dark place I was in and eventually I told myself that it was very pointless of even trying anymore if all I was going to do is fail all over again, I didn't have no type of enthusiasm whatsoever was horrible and all I did every day was loss my enthusiasm more and more until one day I got back up like a normal day and said to myself that "Life doesn't get easier you only have to get stronger' and I realized so much at that moment i wouldn't even believe myself that I was up like nothing and day ago I was not in the right mindset thinking I was a complete failure and even didn't have enthusiasm for nothing. So last I would agree to the saying of the Former British Prime Minister Winston it made me realize a lot and a very true saying of course,
