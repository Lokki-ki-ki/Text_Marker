Each school study more than one hundred students. Many students in high school took not many hard subjects, most of them are art and music. Educational programs already have to take courses during the summer, if student don't finish important subjects. Making room that student finish faster high school, must take courses during the summers or in the evenings or may not be able to take elective courses, is not a good idea. Most of our life need time. Hobby, learning, traveling, study in school. Each doing, need time and study too. What about those who need extra time? What about immigrants, which needs extra time to their homework. Will they be study good? And, will they need this program? They need time to finish their homework. Most of them don't have time to study good with four years education program. Also, what about teachers? Will this subject be interesting to students to study? Will they have time to explain students, what they study? Teacher need some time to be ready for topic that give school to student. Also need enplane this on lesson and after lesson, if student don't understand this on the lesson. Nowbody, don't have extra time. Of course some school can make three year of education, but only some school. Educational program must have extra time and be interesting to all students.
