Some may say that working in a group is better because you have people around you that can help you and support you. You don't have to depend on anyone when your working by yourself. Your focused more and when your focused no one can distract you. You could ask people for help if your confused on something. You don't have to depend on anyone when working alone because if you have a group and one of your group members doesn't show up then your screwed because now you're missing a piece of your project or whatever the situation is. It's going to be hard when working by yourself because everything is depending on you. So you have to do everything on your own. When your working by yourself you are more focused on doing the work. You could listen to music to keep you even more focused. Music keeps you relaxed and calm. You want your work to be nice and organized so that the reader can understand what's going on. Also, you can use the internet to help search information. You can also ask someone for an idea or for a little of help.
