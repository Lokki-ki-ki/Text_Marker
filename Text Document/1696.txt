I would take the offer of finish high school early and stay after school because they're giving a chance to finish early, so you might just take it you get to go to college early and probably get a full time job get your own money and not worry about not having money no more. It is a good idea because some people would like to finish early then late some of them would rather get a job then come to school, but you need education to get a good job and be successful in life and a better job gets you good money for the people that like to spent money on clothes and stuffs like that lot of kids dropping out of school why because like I said they rather get a job then go school, but you need school to get a good job but they giving you the opportunity to graduate early but some kids just gave up on school and drop out of school but I would take the opportunity to finish school early so I can be successful in life and have a better life and not worry about not having money. But some students wouldn't like to come during summer or after school, so they would have to ask all the students, so they can agree to see what they prefer to do like just take the classes the really need for graduation instead of taking classes that you don't need for graduation so they wouldn't have to stay after school or come during summer
