I disagree for adding one and a half of hour in school days. Because reason #1 is that we are in school for 8 hours doing work and other thing, and we get tired, and it's just too much forms kid's or grown-ups. Reason #2 is you don't have a lot of time to do your childhood things cause your in school for 9 hours and 35 mins. For example, you just came out of school your tired you what have fun, but then you got to do homework and that can take hours to finish you're done, but you can't go outside because it's too dark and your parents won't let you cause of hours of school. That's reason #2. Reason #3 is homework you always get home almost every single day doing some extra work and is can take hours to finish. For example, you come out of school at 4:00 you're tired, but you got homework, and then you finish your home for like 2 or 3 hours of extra work, but you can't do anything really fun like go out somewhere with friends because it's too late and dark. That's reason #3. Reason #4 is an appointment you always come out school at 2:45 and your appointment is at 3:00, but you can't go cause you got extra hours in school I know you can leave early but waste you child or grown up learning time in school. That's reason #4. I get it if y'all school's set extra time in school just to make us smart, or have a good life, and a good job, but us kids and adult's need time for are own self, so this is all my reason and example's that I disagree for having extra time in school.
