I am disagree with this because, is going to have a negative effect because, you are going to lose the communication with the people. First reason: you can't go outside to shop.example:when I was in my country, I was going to the store, I was gone in my bike or walk but when I move to the United States I don't need to go because, my mom just call to the store, and they bring the product or food. Second reason: play games with your friends.example: the last week, I ask one of my friend who live in my home country if they continue play games like soccer in the soccer field or another game in the street, he tells that now they play popular games in the phone, and they don't like play games in the street anymore. Third reason: the little boys don't want to do others thing just stay in the phone.example: my little brother who is to years old, he just wants to watch videos on the phone, when my mom takes the phone he cries because he wants to watch videos or play games on the phone he doesn't do other things, he doesn't play with my other brother. Fourth reason:go to visit family or other places.example:when I go to visit my family or other places I can leave my phone because every time we go to visit my family I be bored. And when WI go to visit new places I like to take pictures of the place. Fifth reason: you will be an addicted with your phone or computer.example: I have a friend here in the school who use the phone in the class, sometimes he is play games, sometimes he watches videos, when the teacher look at him, he is in the phone she tells him to put on his packet or in the backpack, but he never does it, sometimes he sits on the back of the room, so the teacher can't see him.
