I think they should not let them bring cell phones during school because they will be entertain. And they will text every time when the teacher is not looking and when ask them a problem they say oh I wasn't paying attention. Or they sometime will say could you repeat it again. Sometimes they are texting to their friend or boyfriend what they are doing instead on focusing on there studying or on there future. And sometime when they are passing the street of school a car come and have an accented just by texting and not focusing if a car is coming. They don't bother to come to school because her friend told her to not go to class. And they talk about people and spreads it around. And they don't care about school but only texting to her friends. And they have low grades by talking to her friends. And they are just talking and talking.
