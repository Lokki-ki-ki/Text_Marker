Do you think that these classes should be electives or a core class?. I say that it should be an elective because some people are taking it as electives, and so they can graduate on time that's why I say they should make these classes go for electives and kids will like more drama and art and or music classes. More than core classes cause core classes are required for graduation and the electives are for fun and I think that the school should give these classes as an elective because it will be fun to learn new things and explore what you would be good at. Some people may believe that you should take a music class, or art class, or drama class however; I believe That those classes should be electives cause their less important than the core classes. But at the same time it would be fun to have one of those classes. And so you experience something new. And you get to meet new and different people and that's why it should be an elective.
