You know what I want to accomplish? Want to be a soccer player. I want to play for my own country and I want to be recognized when I play soccer. It would be really fun to play, train,play championships and play in big events like the World Cup. I want to play soccer for Mexico because Mexico is a good team, and they have good tactics on how to play the game more inffiencetly, and they have good strategies. I want to represent my country when I play because I am representing myself and to the people in Mexico. The team I want to play for having many games such as friendly games. Friendly games is a game of fun not to compete but to have fun. If we want to get better we have to practice and after practice we want to play games. We want to practice getting better and stronger. In practice, we learn things that we have no idea what to do, or we want to learn about it. After practice, we want to get into games and play. We play to learn so that if we lose we get to see where we made our mistakes. We learn those mistakes by learning it so that it won't happen again. Sometimes we don't just play friendly games. We play championships to win trophies. We play in knock out stages which is we win, we go to the next round and if we lose we get knocked out of the championship. Furthermore, we work hard to get trophies. Every game we play in that is a part of championship wise we compete and work very hard to win this trophy, and we try our best to win. Every four years we play in a big event called the World Cup, and we compete to earn a trophy that is made out of all gold. We have to qualify to enter, so we have to play a game to enter. If we win we get into the World Cup, but if we lose we don't get to play. Sometimes we play in leagues, and we have to be first in the stage to get the trophies. We sometimes win but other times we don't.
