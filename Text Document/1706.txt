What do you prefer, keep eating food that do not help you or food that is good for your body? Eat healthier food make your body stronger and helps you to be in good form. I think a change of the lunch menu, could be a good idea. In my soccer team, I have practice every day, after school. Sometimes don't feel good to practice, because the food was not heath to my body, or it wasn't enough. My teammates told me that they bring their own food because the lunch menu of the school do not like them, and they are tired to eat the same food every single daytime students have to go out to buy healthier food. Another reason why the lunch menu should be change is because a healthier lunch, keeps you awake and with energy. Some student need to eat health because they are in school teams. Also, sometimes you feel tired when you are studying. You feel that your stomach hurts and feel that something is wrong with your body, you feel sleepy, sometimes hungry, and you can not concentrate in the class. For example, I have Personal Fitness on my last period, when I eat my regular lunch menu, I feel tired, and sometimes I don't want to do anything because I feel my body too heavy. My doctor, told me that I have to eat healthier. Since, when you are growing up, your body needs food that help it. A change of the school menu could be beneficial for all of us. A healthy body, stronger, and with good aptitude. Our health, depends on all of you. Let's make a change, for the future of all our children. Let know to the principal of all the benefits that This change will bring.
