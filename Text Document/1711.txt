The limitation of human contacted due to the use of technology has a negative effect on people. It prevents the young generation of today basis social skills. It allows bulling on the internet. Furthermore, it also allows trolling on the internet. First, Technology interferes with student social skills. For example, the student walks into the classroom they are in their phones 24/7 of the day. In the classroom the students are on the computers playing video games instead of interacting with one another. In a way people are trapped in their own world it stops people from learning about them self and others. Second, someone can post a video to make a person feel bad about them self attempt suicide. Or a person can post a picture where their drunk, and they post it on Facebook and tag them on it and on Instagram. I saw a video on YouTube. A girl from Australia is getting bullied online, and at school also on the intent and her family had to move at lest 3 time because of this issue. Lastly charting rooms where you can meet serial killers. Fake news post on Twitter spreading rumors for an example Michelle Obama is running for president in 2020. The limitation, First, it percent the young generation basis social skills. Secondly it allows bulling on the internet. Lastly it also allows trolling on the internet. In my opinion we should turn off our phones for at lest 1 to 2 day and going out to eat with our friends without our phones. In school teachers should wait for students outside the door with a box, so they can't use their phones during class. So on bulling last longer and that goes beyond the internet so in conclusion should be stricter, technology limits people talking about their issues.
