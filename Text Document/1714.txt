To Whom It May Concern, I heard that you are looking for an employee who is responsible, hard-working, and has experience on a job. It would be my pleasure to work for you. I have a bit of experience; I'm responsible, respectful, and hard-working. I have a bit of experiences working. Furthermore, I've worked with my mom cleaning houses, hotels, buildings and on multimedia. Furthermore, I also know two languages; Spanish and English. It may take me time understand the routines in the job; but it's not impossible. Once it's in my head what to do and how you want me to work, I won't forget. No one is born knowing things, people have to teach other persons on how to do things right, so they can teach others. You learn from your mistakes. I should be hired for the job, I am perfect for the job. You won't hear any complains about me. You won't regret choosing me. Thank you for taking your wonderful time to read this, have a blessing day. Sincerely, Generic_Name
