I believe that people whom value their self, should be guided for a person who they admire, so they can look at them like a great example to follow and hopefully one day be like them or better. People always make mistakes even though when sometimes we don't admit it, no matter how good we are on something people always need help we can not always do things by our own. We always require someone to tell us that we are doing wrong. Even in some circumstance we need to grow up and believe and our self, that we have the capacity like everyone else, to make our dreams comes true even when things go wrong, that does not mean anything is just a challenge that we need to pass to make us stronger. However, just for being clear doing things by your own is fine, but if we have the incredible responsibility to have someone always there for you who you trust in. I think is the safe way to go because today's days this person whom use to give you advice and support you rarely appear, so do the best person you can and remember ask for help is just an option to help you out and improve the best of you.
