IT will help they can be friends, like they tell something about them self, or they will fight either like some older students make fun of the younger kids that will be a problem to me this how it will go down the younger kids start fighting back, and then it will be a war zone of fight older vs younger. There is no reason what will their reaction be to me back in the day, they didn't know what the older students and younger students react I bet they pray for the older students and younger students to get along on the first day of school, to see their reaction. What I think is it will be normal the effects like they will get use to it, and they will mine they old business plus to me, they will say we going to have to treat the younger students the same as everybody else. The older students have to assist the younger students, to do service hours or get credit on service and to do more and more service hours. The older students are having bad grades in classes, their teacher will get a student who is really smart to be the older student twofer.
