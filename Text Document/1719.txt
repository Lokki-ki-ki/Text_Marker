When the entire class need to make a project in groups, but your group work more than the rest of the class do you think it's fair if the teacher give a praising to the entire class? When I think about praising student work, I think in: hard work, effort, patience, and a consistent student. I agree with the self-esteem come from praise. Also praising students help to built self-steam, but you only can praise when the student make your best effort. For example; one student go to the bed at three in the morning and sleep only three hours making his project and checking all the project make sure is complete, but other student go to the bed at nine and sleep all night and don't worry about his project. Some students are more lazy than the others. The best decision the teacher can make is recognize the student who really make the best work and effort. However, some people believe that praise given for deficient work undermines learning by lowering standards. The teacher recognize student's work maybe work more hard in the next project or homework. If the teacher built a self-esteem praising students must be self-confident in order to learn. They believe teachers need recognize all student's work not only some students. In conclusion the teachers only need to recognize student's work when the students really make a good work, the best effort and this way the teachers can help to built self-esteem and motivate the student work hard in all the classes, projects, and homework. Student's with a high self-esteem are the students who make a lot of things is this world. Many times the students with high self-esteem are the students who go to the university, because they know are good in something; this is the reason because we have today doctors, lawyers, teachers, other professional people.
