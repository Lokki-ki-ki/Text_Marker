Churchill's statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success? Success consists of going from failure without loss in enthusiasm. I think that Churchill's is wrong about that failure of the plays in the pursuit of success because not many people are failure of there success and many people are in inspired from what they are going and so many people are pursing a failure. Firstly, not many people are failure of there success. For example people that are failure is not succeeding in doing something else. Let's say that student that goes to school that they don't want to succeeded in there education. That they don't want there education for college or a university if they don't succeed. Another example is if you are not succeeding then you can't do something just as outcome. Secondly, many people are inspired from what they are going to be succeeding. For instance people are working or getting a job they have to be inspired of their job they have to succeeded in what they are going. They have to love they job or do a better to succeeded in their job. If you succeeded in your job you might get a raise. Thirdly, so many people are pursing to failure. They don't want to pursuit anything because if they do then they are not succeeding in doing something else. For example if a student want to graduate on time with their classmates they have to get good grade pass the sol then he has to succeeded in school. They have to be enthusiasm meaning they have to be inspired. Iin conclusion Winston Churchill's is a failure of the plays in the pursuit because not many people are failure that who want to success and many people are inspired from want there are going and finally so many people are pursing to failure.
