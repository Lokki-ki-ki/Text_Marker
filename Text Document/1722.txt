The ancient Greek storyteller said no act of kindness shouldn't be wasted because They want everyone to be kind like they say no act of kindness should never be wasted. They want everyone to be kind and no wasting act of kindness. My opinion I would at least do one to five acts of kind less a day to make someone happy. If you do an act of kind less you might get some to say something good about to make you feel good. It is nice to do in general. You can feel good if you gave some a complement of there self and make them feel good. You can make someone day because they might have had A bad day, and you gave them a complement and that make them feel good. I think the author made this because they can make people feel good. The ancient Greek is really old, and they were doing a lot of act of kind less. The ancient Greek storyteller said no act of kindness no act of kind need should never be wasted no matter how small. I think Aesop is an ancient Greek king That can tell people to do act of kind less. He said in his words NO! Act of kind less should never be wasted for no small reason I think that means that everyone should do a series among of acts of kind less a day like I said that I would do like one to five acts of kind less a day to make someone happy. I think That is why he wants everyone to do acts of kind less. For people
