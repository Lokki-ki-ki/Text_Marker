From my view point I'm really sure that never would be possible to change it, because there a few factors that cannot make that possible. People can not forget the first impression they have from you. I went to play soccer a few years ago it was my first time, that day I knew too many new people from everywhere around the world. We were played soccer, and they told me that I'm so good for soccer they like the way that I play it. Now everywhere when they see me they say to me '' hey you play perfect for real ''. So here is the conclusion. People never going to forget the first impression that they get from you those people still remember me the time goes fast i didn meet them for a year and half and the impression still stay that they think that I'm perfect for soccer. Some people say that impression can be change not matter if it is good or bad impression but you have to work really hard for it and It's going to take a long time.
