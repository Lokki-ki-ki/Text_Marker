Thomas Jefferson wrote determine never to be idle, it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing something, people can accomplish if we are always doing something, people can follow his purpose what they want because all people can be done with want they accomplish in ours life its many things that can we do something. First, People like to be idle with other people like in some works when they do not want to employ in his works just because they have an inability personal but if people want to accomplish. They can do something like in his home or a thing easy that they can make, for follow living but some people something just think about what they want to make his purpose, but they never do something. Second, People can follow his purpose and doing something wonderful, but if they do not are idle for example in some works like that people who work. In some place the boss are idle and that do that people leave that job for his idle personality it is wonderful if people do something good for his life because, some people do things bad and that happen that in some place never proposed something. Third, In some place or country are bad, because people do not accomplish to have a good country because they do not do something good, for example something steal person, and happen that country accomplish a purpose we need to accomplish what we can or what we what for ours life, and do not be idle because are idle do not help for make something better for ours life, so we need to have patience with want we accomplish. We need to doing something good for examples, people that work in office need to be amiable with people that need something most of the people who work in office do not have to be idle. Also be a wonderful person in jobs like restaurant help to have more client but depend on how the people serve. So first to all we accomplish more if we are always doing something for ours life and do not do bad things that do not help for what to accomplish, so we need to think first the things and glide that things what we want to do.
