Some schools have a program that pairs older students with younger students. I think this program is good idea for the students because it will help them work together. And it will be good for them, so they can be able to learn from each other. It will help the older students to be able to do something after school and help out in there community. Also, it will help them get battle in school. They can learn to work with the younger kids. Therefor it will help teachers to be able to get there work done at that time. It will also help their teachers. For the younger students it will help them learn from the older students and there younger friends. It will also help them in school too to be able to listen to their teachers and their families. It will help them to get smart in school, Help one other, understand from each other and anchor each other. There for it help there grades get battler. And it will help there parents that work later to get there work down when there kids are at the program. So there parents don't have to get off work, so they can get their kids. And it will also help them make more friends and get to know each other.
