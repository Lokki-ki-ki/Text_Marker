My argument about the 10pm curfew for teenagers statement; is they should have a curfew for teenagers because it can get them out of trouble, and make it home safe, and they can get rest for school. Example of staying out of trouble is you can get mistaken at night; and get hurt just by not going home at the right time. Another example a teenager can be at their friends house and if they leave late or outside with their friend, anybody can be outside and would want to hurt them or there friend because it's dark out, but if you have the 10 pm curfew you can leave without worrying about being in trouble. Also can have a guardian to pick you up when It's late, so this scenario would not happen. Another reason is to get some good rest for school and have lots of energy. If you do not have enough sleep, but can have the 10 pm curfew to help you to get some rest and will also help you concentrate in school. An example for this is a teenager could be outside, and they do not have a curfew, so the teenager comes home late. And does not get good sleep or no sleep and goes to school tired and can't concentrate. A good counter-claim for both is you can just stay home and don't have worry about a curfew or going home really late. Because if you are scared to go home late or can't get some rest just stay home. You will be more safe home with a guardian or sibling than outside in the dark and not knowing who is outside. And parents should just be more protective, so they don't end up going home late. And they can stay home and sleep earlier and get lots of rest for school. With both arguments I think the best for teenager is that they should have a curfew just for safety reasons. And no parents should be worried or scared for there kids being outside late because there city council do not have a curfew. And another reason is they can get good sleep for teenagers is very helpful for them, so they can have a lot of energy and concentrate in class better and get good grades.
