Former British Minister Winston Churchill once said that 'success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. Many people are not perfect and fail, and some think failure is bad. Failure is actually good, because it teaches you what was wrong. Although some people may think that failure does not play a role in success, it should be known that failure dose play a role in success. One of the reason failure plays a role is that people can learn from their mistake. When people fail they can find out what went wrong instead of giving up, Another reason is failure makes people stronger. A lot of times failure may cause people stress, and stress makes people strong and not give up. Also, failure helps people become better people. Leaning from there failure. Although some people think incorrectly that failure do not play a role in success it should be known that it does play a role in success, because you can lean from your failure, failure makes you stronger, and failure makes you a better person. People should not give up when they fail, they should learn and try again until they succeed.
