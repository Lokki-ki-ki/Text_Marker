Dear principally name is STUDENT_NAME and I don't agree with the new school sports policy. My opinion about the school policy that no one should be left behind that every one should have a chance to participate in the sport that they want to play. Am an example because I can't play sports because of my grades I love to play volleyball butt I cant participate I fell left out. When I see the other girls with there uniform am I just look away that just makes me fell like dam I should be on the team. I know that there are more kids out there that want to participate and fell the same why I do. Some kids that I know are in gangs because of that reason. Ether just because of that resounds that they can't participate. T
