Determine to do not be idle is hard because we do not imagine us doing something if we never do it because we are very idlest to do it. We do not imagine how wonderful can be if we never do it.Let's say that you want to be a soccer player, but you are so idlest to do it, like you are imagined that you are the best soccer player of the world, you earn a million of millions of dollars with a lot of girls around you and a lot of fame. How you want to accomplish that if you are so idlest to do start doing it. If to want to be the best soccer player of the world that you imagine in your mind, wake up 6 or 5 am and start practicing and running and training your body and do not be a slacker lying in your bed imagine something that you can do it. Other people say that be idle is good and is right. There are many persons like inventors or scientist that they have great ideas when they are sleeping or when they are lying in the bed, but when that brilliant idea comes to they mind, they don't stay right there imagine that idea. They get up, and they start working in that idea that they have, and they work day and night until they complete, and they make it real. If you want to be idle is good like no one going to stop you, but if you want to do something, or you have to do something go and do it. Or if you have an idea, but you are lazy to do it get up and start working on that. Be idle in your free time.
