An enjoyable educational activity could be playing an instrument, an instrument could teach someone to practice every day, by practicing could lead you to learning new techniques to play that type of instrument. Being inspired by someone to do that instrument or what ever you want to do you need someone to motivate you for example, there was this one time when my brother motivated me to play the hello and I did and it felt good, because I practiced everydaycand I loved doing it. That's why practicing is important. Having fun while playing in band or orchestra your able to travel to different states to learn how different groups play, learn different songs, and learn the sites of that certain city. That's why I joined orchestra when I was about 9-10years old I learned about 20 new songs that 1 school year and I loved doing it. It was fun to watch, and hear them while playing it was probably the best year I had in 3rd grade. The people in your group are like your family you guys are going to travel together and perform together. And even making friends to the new kids who join later in the year so don't worry about being left out while traveling to that certain state your always going have someone to talk to be around. Toucan also make friends in the new state you travelled to that's why playing an instrument is so enjoyable.
