In my opinion I think a homework club would be great, most students want to fix the grades and get better ones mostly with subjects they struggle with usually math or sci ens but with extra help the student will be able to understand better which helps raise there grade. Teachers are usually very open when it comes to help but most students are afraid to ask, with this club it will be easier to ask for help from the teachers. I don't see a lot of cons with this idea but I tried my best find some, some students are fairly slow learners, and it usually takes up time to teach them, It's also hard for the student to be engaged in what there learning. Most students have after school activities other than the homework club. Like sports and might arrive late to their activities. There might not be enough people to help, though I doubt that there won't be enough people to help it may be possible but in a different way after school or work people are usually tired and don't have enough energy to stay engaged in learning or teaching. Back to pros ya know the good stuff, mental health almost every student goes through a Fate where the stress levels are high, but most of that stress comes from is school work, with the club teachers will be able to helps students with homework, students will be used to asking for help. I think this club is a good idea it will defiantly help students learn better while there struggling.
