Dear principal, ''This is what I think about community service."I think community service is helpful because you can help the community. For example, some tutor elementary school children and others clean up litter. Community service is helpful because you can help people in the hospital, and you can clean the streets. By helping people in the hospital, you can help people that are sick and in the streets you can help clean up from the parks and the street floor. Also, I think that the principal should decide the people that should do community service. One way that the principal should decide is by choosing the people that got a 75% or higher on their report card.
