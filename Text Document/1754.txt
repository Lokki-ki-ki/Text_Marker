My uncle has in his wallet 100 dollars, he gives to me 10 and stay with the rest, I tell him to save the money for tomorrow he will need it, but he spends all the money to buy shirt pants and hats, and the next day he was asking for money for the gas for the car. My uncle was happy for the money and to buy things with the money and for not listen we are need it for tomorrow. He spends all the money in things that are good for him but he's knowing he will need it, for tomorrow he spent it, are all. Why seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. Once of my friend was having money on his packet he says,"let's go watch a movie on the cinema". But all the rest of my friend we tell him to "NO", Because the movie was already in CD and was much less money than go watch it in the cinema. When my friend recipe ours opinions we see the situation in other perspective of the was thinking. Even my friend want to watch the movie on the cinema, should be a to spend a lot of money to pay. And that how we tell him to buy it. When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. My Dad give to be money to buy anything that I want, knowing that tomorrow I will need a white shirt, I buy a game and my dad tell me about the place that we need to go and will need the shirt and for my obsession for the game the next day was asking if they can give me money to buy the shirt, and my dad tell me yesterday,"I tell you to buy it, but you don't listen to me". Even I knew about the shirt, this happens because I didn't listen, In addition, all the talk and learning, and that day after the money I save it for this type of case. The case that happen in resume, all talk about how important is that to listen to the people around you, All this situation happens because there were listen to the person next to it. And you, In sometimes is okay to that more than one person talk to you?
