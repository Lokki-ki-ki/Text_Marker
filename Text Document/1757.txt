Dear principalI think that you should require students to perform community service.It will help all elementary school students to do better on their school work. You can let students that are interested in this program to participate in it.Students that do not want to participate, must let them do what they want.Principal I will be part of this program and I will help those elementary school students.You still have to ask the students that are interested if this program will affect their grades in school.I will help you organize this program.I will also bring as many tutors as possible.Furthermore, I will try to make this program successful.Many other students and parents are going to help us organize this program.This program is going to help educate many elementary school students and make a good future for them.I will do my best to make those students successful.You should announce this program to the whole school so many people can participate.We need as many students as possible.Helping people is one of my hobbies.We can also provide different interesting stuff that students can do during tutoring time.We can provide sports and other things that they want.Furthermore, we can make it as an after school program.Furthermore, we should also provide buses to people that are going to stay.Mr. Principal let me handle this program and make it ready for all students.We should do our best to help those kids.Parents can also help.You can also ask for donations.Mr. principal it's my pleasure to help all students that need help.Sincerely: your studentDate: 2/15/11
