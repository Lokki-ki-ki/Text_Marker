Yes, I agree. I agree because the success consists of keep trying without never loss the enthusiasm. You need to keep trying until you get what you want because that's the goal. I will give you, and tell you what a pass through like an example. When I came to the United States; It was a May 21, 2014 (I think that's the correct day, I'm not sure). I was 13 years old, almost 5 years ago. I didn't know any English, but I said to myself, "I'm never giving up, until I get it". That was my goal. I learned some English, how to write it, and how to speak it, although I'm still learning it, but I keep going trying it without giving up, and the most important think is without losing the enthusiasm because if we want something, we need to keep going, and trying until we get it. Some people think they can do it, and those people prefer to gave up, and NO! That's wrong. YOU NEED TO KEEP GOING UNTIL YOU GET IT, and NEVER GIVE UP! That's it. :)
