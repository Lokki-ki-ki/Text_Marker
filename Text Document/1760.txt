In my opinion. I agree with Emerson to be right when he wrote everyone can do any things, but not every one wants to work hard to do. Example. In my personal I think to have my own helicopter in the future. In this word eve thing goods is possible something more than more beyond whatever my effort my or how many I give to sporting them. Even in my life or my phat way so many difficult, but I believed in my faith there is nothing impossible. But I have to work hard to get them, because nothing come easy, everything have price first then came be true, But I can't lose anything to try, try and try because will be successful In the future. Even if I see now only in my dream and, dream in my future it's already mastered. The people never grow because they fear to try, to do some highest or highest is the most enemy myself. I can't grow more toll, but I tread believed in my self and first God, will be grown me in wisdom that is my best part I can't do by myself, the first thing to is to have good health, and my family to. So I agree to do something beyond what I already Mastered.
