One topic" success consist of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm". When the person want to progress with something the person maybe failure or maybe not, if you work hart and you focuses your goals because everybody try to do some better on his life. I'm agree with Churchill' because the statement is important role not always your won when the people have a goal, each time when we try something new, we will be able to success the first time but the problems is to how your work for you not failure on your life. When you start everything is enthusiasm only you know how work going for the future you can't not failure. Second reason, the British prime minister say that because maybe he does something, and he tries to do with different ways. The British look at for you wan to have something good or other thing is when you start, but the first thing is when you failure because not always your won on your goals but if you want to memories your own life, you need to focus on goals and them you will have your success on life. When you get a success, your was enthusiasm. Last reason, I see if you want to be successful on your high school or in your job you only need is believe in your self. Because you are unfocus at 100% when you want or need something that was being easier for you because you work really hart for take a success because when you have success you was an enthusiasm and them you try to work more and them in your future was more success.conclusion. To the British say that is really important because not all person want to work hart for won and them take success.
