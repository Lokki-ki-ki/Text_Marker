Good Morning, I just want to start this letter by telling you a little more about my interest towards your company. As a matter of fact, the day I heard about the opportunities our school were giving to some students to be able to visit some companies. I absolutely want it participate, Because I want to developed more practice and skills about the job I would want to have when I get out of Collage. Farther more, I'm very interest to work for a Microsoft company that has being my dreams since the day I started using computers and I would want it create something that can help others and create new technology for future Generations. However, in my school there's not a lot of programs or class about computer management or software programming, that could help me and other students to improve our nonage about computer Software. I would want to learn more and get more experience about creating and fixing computers. For sure working at a Microsoft company is what I want to do for a living. Also allowing me to come and visit one of the companies would help me understand what I'm going to be facing in the future when I start working for a big company example, what is exactly the job I'm going to be doing or what job I be able to do enjoy doing, or what is going to take to get there etc. If you allow me this opportunity I can show you my skills, and you can see and judge me by my job or what I can do. I believe I can be capable to do very creative work and come up with ideas in a matter of seconds to improve new produce. And this opportunity can help me figure out what other type of work I can be able to do. I appreciate the opportunities your companies are giving to our school and other schools in general, but now I would want to know if you could give me chance and the privilege to come to one of your companies and learn more about Microsoft Programming and computers. I believe I can apport a lot to this company.
