Yes, I am agree with Emerson's statement about show your own individuality. I believe that each person has 2 face's 1 is used in the work or in the school, and the other face is showing on specific moments in your life as stress or your soccer team is losing 5-2.one example of that is: when you are so angry an involuntary you use bad word, and after that you feel very well with yourself. Although what you make, but some part of you is broken for what you did;That simple think make you more human as anyone in this world, because is unnecessary try to be perfect when you are not ready to be perfect in this accomplishment and wonderful world. Being more specific about my statement lets talking about; a teenager he has 17 years their birthday is on january 12 when he come to United States he had 14 years then in 3 years on school. He makes friends, but those were more adult's for them, but that névé was something important to him that really change now, nevertheless every friend that he make left the school, the altitude of him change now;he makes sure to pass 2 Sols in the 11 grade, but also something in their hearth was gone. He is trying to make new friend's but no matter HOM much he wants their head is thinking just as an adult; I think that this teenager can make new friend's why it is simple he has other face, but his feelings are from a child.
