Students could not be required to take a music, a drama or an art class. Student should only be required to take classes that they actually need. Having to take those classes just adds classes you need to graduate. It is also all a waist of time if the students are not actually in to it. Firstly, these classes are just extra classes that we don't really need. In my opinion, I believe that student should be able to graduate high school with the classes they need. English, Math, History and Science are all classes that can support them when they go to college. If student don't take these classes they may also graduate earlier then they are supposed to. For example, I go to a high school where I get the credits I need, and I am able to graduate a year earlier. Which I think everyone should have the chance too. Lastly, if a student is not interested in one of these classes they won't try. Even if they do try and fail then its just holding them back. They will start stressing over it when they won't actually end up needing it. Student will also consume most of their time bringing up their grade in these classes that they will not work on other classes. Then they will end up failing. On the other hand, some might say these classes should be required because student might find interest in one of those and would like to pursue it after graduating. I think that if a student is interested then they should be allowed to take the class of your choice. However, if your not then you should not be pushed to take them when you don't want to. In conclusion, student should not be forced to take elective classes. If they want to they should but if not then they shouldn't need it to graduate. Electives are just extra classes needed to graduate, and they also have no point if the student are not actually interested. Po p
