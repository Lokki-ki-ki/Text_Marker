I agree with the idea of a year-round school because It sounds great to me. This idea has a lot of benefits towards the students and also the educators too. This idea provides a beneficial environment for both the students and the educators. One of the reasons that this is a great idea is that, It makes the students to retain information easily when they get back from their break. They would retain information easily because the break they were given wasn't a long break and that will help them remember the materials that they were taught before the break. The other reason is that, the students will gain more knowledge by learning more materials. They will learn a lot of which will be beneficial to them, not only inside the school but also outside the school. They will also stay on task and be more focused on their studies. Another reason is that, this idea of a year-round school will make work easy for the educators. It will make their work easy by not making them repeat the materials that they previously have taught because the students are able to remember the materials easily. They won't be forced to create retake tests and assignments and that would allow them to have an easy job. An example of why a year-round school is beneficial is that, It creates an environment where the students enjoy learning, and the educators enjoy teaching. Lastly, I would say that a year-round school is a great idea because It creates an environment where both the students and the educators can benefit from. It Impacts both the students and the educators productively. The students would have more passion and love towards learning while the educators would also gain more passion towards their profession and remarkably enjoy teaching.
