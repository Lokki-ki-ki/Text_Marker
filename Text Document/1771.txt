The reason why the school board shouldn't add hours to school because students already go to school too much, and they would like more time off of school, so they can do their homework, hangout with their friends, play sports out of school, and get more time to do their chores around the house. The school board shouldn't add more hours because if students have appointments then they will have to put a later time but if the place of their appointment closes a little early then the students will have to leave school and that will make them have missing work, late work, more work to do at home with little amount of time, and more stress for the students to finish the work on time. If the school board adds hours it will become a disaster for the students that have a job and need to get there in time also if they live far from their job their boss could get mad at them for being late and if they don't believe their worker they could get fired and then the student won't have a job, they won't get paid, and they won't have money to pay for what they need. This is why the school board shouldn't add hours to school.
