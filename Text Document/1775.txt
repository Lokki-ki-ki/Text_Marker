I agree with this statement because the students need to finish the school for graduate. Many parents support they's sons. After you finish the school need to looking for a job. For example i divided my time for study and working after school. It's a hard work but is necessarily for a better life. The people need to divide the time for doing many things. Many people do not do the school for different reasons for example, dissolution with the parents a bad relationship parents with the sons. Sometimes the students do not pay attention in class because in home they have a lot of problems. The students can't concentrate because the problems between the parents affect they's life. My life is come be hard because I do not have my parents by my size is sadness know they's far away of me. Keep you brain busy thinking good idea is better that stay on home doing anything. When I was begun to study I was so scared because I had no idea about a word in English. The teacher do not understand the Spanish people, if they are in similar situation was same thing because they don't speak Spanish.
