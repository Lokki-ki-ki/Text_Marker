Dear: Generic_Name Understand that you are considering the idea to work in group. I appreciate what are you trying to do, and I agree with, for two reasons I think working in group can give you a lot of benefits because you can help each other, so you can do a better job and, also you can share different ideas with your partners. The first reason is that you can do a better job working in group. For example when I am working in group in my job I ask my partners to check my work to make sure I am doing a good job.additionally, you can share different ideas with your partners or also, you can share your toys that you usually use for work. For example when I am working in group with my class I always ask my friends if I can use their stuff.Therefore, I strongly believe that working in group give you a lot of benefits. Which I allow with positive for two reasons. You can do a better job helping each other and, also you can share your ideas with your partners. thanks for your time.sincerely:Generic_Name
