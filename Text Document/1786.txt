Do you agree or disagree with the statement?in my personal opinion I do agree that first impressions are almost impossible to change. It's impossible to change because that's the very first time you meet someone new in your life. First impressions are very important. There is no way you can change first impressions it's not like we can go back in time to switch our answer. Making a bad first impression can go very wrong but that's that its done, and you can't go back. For example like making a first impression at a job interview like obviously making a good impression is very important if you want a job.I can also understand why some may say "almost impossible" because technical you kinda can. For example if both of you say "can we start over" or something like that. Your always going to have that impression from the first time you guys ever meet. So really it goes both ways how someone may take it. I personal don't agree with that because it doesn't sound right or feel right. Some may move on and actually forget. While others may not and mentally remember.in conclusion it is all based on the reader and how they take it. Like I have mention i personal don't think you can change your first impression. We can't go in time and change the past. It consent sound reasonable there's no real reason. Some may agree with what I say some may not. Then again I can kinda see how someone may want or how to change there first impression.
