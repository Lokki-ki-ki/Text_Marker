Generic_Name10/23/2018Schools should extend time by two hours because students will have more time to do there class work. If a student have more time to do there class work then they will not have there class work as homework. Having more time in school means that you can get your work done and have extra time to do their class work. In my old school we only had seven hours of school, and we have eight classes in a day. Most of the time we barely had time to finish over class work, so we had to finish it as homework. We also did not have time to do labs, experiment, and project. That's why having more time can help us do all of those things. Another reason would be is that teachers will have time to enplane to students things that they do not get. Teachers have time to enplane things to a student and help them understand more about what they are learning. In the movie Matilda students there only had six hours of school and teachers did not have time to enplane things to students. Students only went to school, took notes, and went back home. Sense they had no time at school to do class work they had a lot of homework. Most of them did not even finish there homework because sit was too much. At the end of the move students had taken an exam, and they had the whole six hours to finish it. When the time was up nine person of the students did not finish so they automatic failed. If only they just had more time, more students would have passed the exam. Another reason would be that having more time can help students is that scientists prove that having more time added in a school schedule will help students ingress there academic by ten person. That means if I spend more time in school learning I will become smarter than students with a regular schedule. Having more can help students finish work they would not normal finish when they have a regular schedule.
