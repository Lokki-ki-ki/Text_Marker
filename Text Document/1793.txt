Have you ever wondered what it would feel like to be in a school play? I have, one enjoyable activity I would want to be is a school play. I think this will be an enjoyable activity for school because you can meet new people, work with a team, and most of all have a great time. During the play the cast members can make new friends and meet new people. It's important that the cast gets to know each other and become friends. Also, they can rehear lines together. It's also helpful to make new friends especially if you shy. It's important not to be shy on the night of the actual play. You have to be brave and have confidence in yourself for the night of the play. Another example why this would be an enjoyable activity for school is working together as a team. Working together as a team can be enjoyable and important. For example the cast can help build sets, make costumes, rehears lines, and so much more. Sometimes after rehearsals the cast can go out to eat or have fun. Also working together as a team is easier, so you can get more work done. The last reason why having a play is enjoyable because after all the hard work with the team everyone can watch the play. You will be able to perform the play in front of students, teachers,friends, and families. The most important thing is that you had a fun time making, being in the play, and working with other students. Being in a play is and enjoyable activity because you can meet new people, work as a team, and have fun. Those were a couple of reasons and examples on why having a school play is an enjoyable school and educational activity.
