March 12, 20019The technology allows people to complete many tasks without having contact with others. People can check out books, shop, and play games without speaking to another person. Has the limitation of human contact due to use of the technology had positive or negative effects on peoples lives. In my opinion there are more negative than positive effects about technology of a negative effect is. Play games without speaking. We should meet the person first than start to play with that person. Instead of play via any web with someone that we do not know who is. There is another negative effects, kids, and teenagers are able to be in contact with bad people. Like kidnappers, these are bad people who take advantages of the technology attacking the most vulnerable in technology the kids make the kids feel confident, and feel they are their friend. There are pedophiles too, looking for kid and teenagers. Also, because of the technology many frauds are occurring every day hackers stolen some of our personal information. Like our names, address, social security number, banks accounts information, and make frauds to companies. In conclusion, I believe that the technology has many negatives effects in our social livest is bad for our kids, and our information in risk, I wish we could find a safety way to use it.
