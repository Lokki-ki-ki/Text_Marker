Imagine there were no school and attending classes from home. I do not think students attending classes from home by way of online or video conferencing will not benefit, Because classes at home will not benefit the student. He or She will take Advantages by watching online videos, Playing games and not studying. Students will not take classes from home serious. Attending classes from home will be a distraction due to family issues and noises at home will not help student to pay attention. Attending classes at home will not help student by not knowing general knowledge, Getting to know things around the world, Not able to meet new people and not being able to feel how the world is. Some say attending classes from home by way of line or video conferencing will be benefit for students they are wrong because, Some student needs help from their classmate. Some student also learn from teachers than attending classes from home by way of online or video conferencing.
