First impressions are not "almost impossible to change". They can be difficult to change, but they aren't almost impossible to change because there are ways that can help you change your first impression. A thing about first impression is to question yourself on is "how can I change my own first impression?" A lot of people say it's almost impossible to change your own first impression, but what they don't realize is that they aren't thinking hard enough to comprehend to understand why they aren't almost impossible to change, so they instead just don't even try and use more of their cognitive ability. What's important about first impressions is having to say something that will impress others. When you use more of your cognitive ability, then you'll be able to come up with better first impressions. Once you're able to come up with a better first impression; you'll find it easier than what other people said based on their opinion. In conclusion, first impressions are a lot easier to change when you think about how you'll change your first impression and when you come up with a better one, but it takes time to develop(also don't overthink it because this can cause stress and also won't help you use more of your cognitive ability).
