People say first impressions are almost impossible to change. I think you can change someone by getting to know each other, spending more time together, or ask them how they feel. If you start talking to someone for the first time, and you think their personality is awful try to know the person more. In my experience, when I see someone for the first time like at work or school right away I think they're mean from their face expressions and attitude. Sometimes they think the same way too, so they are mean back. You should spend time together and go to places where both of you guys like to go. Their attitude might have changed because maybe they needed someone to talk to and go out more. There's people that their personality are just different, and you have to accept it. Lastly, People go through a lot in life and their personality starts to change. Also, you have to ask them how they feel because sometimes they feel depressed or angry about something and need someone to talk to. It's better to be there for them or help each other out. In conclusion, people say "Don't judge a book by its cover" because you never know why they behave like that. If you don't know them, still ask if they're okay. It is possible to change their personality and make them a better person.
