I really think that can be really stressed for some students, because there is more pressure for them, because they are taking courses on evenings or summer school, when some of them needs to work, or they have to do somenthings at home, but that is a good idea to have 3 years of high school because they are doing just 3 years they can go early to college if they want or another place like NOVA, but on my thought I will never choose to have just 3 years because I feel that can be really stressed for me, but I know if you want to graduate early nothing is impossible, but if you want to choose just 3 years you have to be positive and had discipline, but there are some students that want to choose this kind of programs, and they want to, but they are not ready for this kind of pressure, there is no reason for them to feel bad because there are more chances on the future, they do not have feel pressure because they fail everything happens for a reason. And my position on this issue is not to choose this kind of programs.
