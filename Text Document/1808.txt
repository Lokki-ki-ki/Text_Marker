At some point in every one's life, There is a time to be self-reliant. People should make their own decisions, Because, As a self-reliant person, making a decision based on someone else's advise can be very risky. For example, buying an insurance plan, going based in someone else's coverage will cover something you don't need, while if chosen based on your needs there wouldn't be a problem.Self-reliance is very important for person to become independent. If one does not trust themselves how will they grow. For example, A famous quote by Micheal Jordan say's "You miss 100% of the shots you don't take". This quote alludes to the fact that as an individual it is important to have self-confidence in their decision-making, because if you don't take a risk in making your own decision you will 100% miss the shot you take.Furthermore, Making o's own decisions are important, because, People will not always be there, and you will be forced to make your own decisions. For example choosing your own apartment isn't anybodies else's job but yours. Choosing an apartment is very important and one must have self-reliance in order to make the right decision for themselves. In conclusion being self-reliant is the most important skill you could have, while, I could see the other side saying that going to an expert is the best way to make a tough decision while that may be true, they will not always be there for you.
