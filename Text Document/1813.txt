This program will help both with the older and younger student because, the older student have more experience than younger student. The older students know a lot of things more than younger students because the older student knows how to read, knows how to do math, and knows science and social study. But, sometimes older student might forget about things that they were taught in elementary school. Also, there are some new ways that the elementary student are taught in a different way because it would make it easier for the younger student to understand it more, or the younger student is taught something new, and they can help the older student understand what this new idea is, and the older student teach new things for them to know and be papered. When the older student teach the younger students, they want to paper them because when they start a new unit and the younger student heard of what the unit is about, they know and understands them and will get good grades, and the older students wants the younger student to be papered for next year or this year, also the older student wants the younger students to improve their grades and their test grades. When the school has a program that pairs older student and the younger student, it helps them because they have new ideas, and they know a lot of new different subject that the older students don't know about the subject or an equation. Also, they can bond and tell them how it's like being a kid now days, and the older student tells their stories about their childhood and what it was like being a kid in the past. The older and younger student have different experience with their childhood and their elementary, which they can help with each other and the program for the older and younger student will help them improve their skills and their grades.
