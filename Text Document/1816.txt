I think is designs of everyone because if you are smart and if you want to graduation in three year just you have to focus and give your best, and you have the design in your hands if your design is yes so do it, because another students can't do it or didn`t like, so I think is optional, for my self I think is greet idea just take three year of the high school but I know is not easy because take the high school in three year is very complicated because you well have to take course during the summers and may not be able to take elective houses, but you advance is good. Reasons. (why is good)because is good for you live because you have one year early and this can help you to do it a Greek student and with this year early you can go to the college early, or you can work one year and after this year you can star the college, and if your finis the high school in three year that mean you are a good student and that's can help you because you can find a program that can help you, because if you want to go to the college is not chip and for follow your dream you have found a solution and the solution is give you best. Example. Because if you find a program that can help you, so you can follow what you want to do it in a future. If you are a bad student and you GPA is so down you can't go to the college because for going to college, I think you GPA have to do more the 3.00 for you can go a good college.That's why I think is good take the high school in three year, because you can have more opportunities for well have a good future. Conclution. Yes is good idea that students to finish high school in three years because is something like well better for you future, in your live. But everything is your decision you know what you want to do with life and if you don't know what you want to do just think about in you future and that's you can find the answer and believe in yourself that you can do it.
