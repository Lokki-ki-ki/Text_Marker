I agree with this statement because it's impossible to change these impressions. Some people have physical problem it's impossible to change. Lots of people have mental problem with getting mad. If somebody has mental problem maybe they fight with someone. They have to go to hospital to check up. If they take some medicine maybe they get better. When they have physical problem they're yelling on the street and running and lots of people scared from them. They family have to keep them at home. If they didn't safe at home. There family can take them to lunatic asylum because they can't stay at home they go out and did something to the people. People can call to Police and maybe police arrest them then they get trouble from police. There parent should protect them from this disaster. If they want to go out there parent go with them because it's safety for them. For parent this condition is distress. This condition of doing something badly for parent. If this kind of condition they have they do care for children. They have frustration about children because this condition is very badly. They can't go outside they stay all the time at home. If parent go out maybe child go outside and again he/she did something badly in public. If they want to walk outside by them self they can't because they have to go with parent. Some parent they take them children into park they want to play, but reason is there is lots of kids playing. If he/she did something to kids is very bad situation. This mental problem very badly.
