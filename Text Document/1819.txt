For example, There was a boy named Generic_Name. Generic_Name was in high school, and he was in tenth grade. Generic_Name wanted to be a nurse, but his parent didn't want him to be a nurse because they knew that nurse didn't have a lot of money. Generic_Name also wanted to become rich, so he could help his family. But Generic_Name dreamed so little for himself. Generic_Name hated when his parent told him that he was not going to be a nurse. When he went to school the next day, he told his friend what his parent told him. Generic_Name friend also knew that being a nurse would not help Generic_Name, so he decided to tell him the truth.``Generic_Name maybe your parents are right.", He said.`` Isn't nurse a good job too?," Generic_Name asked.``It is, It's just that being a nurse is no good for you and your parents," He said.``Why," Asked Generic_Name.``Because it doesn't have enough money for you and your parents," He said. When Generic_Name went home, he started thinking maybe his friend was right. He took a lot of time thinking about it. So he decided to be a soldier. At first, he didn't want a soldier then he thought about it and he decided to go to soldier school. When he was graduated he went to collage. He worked really hard. When he finished his school, he employed for the soldier work. The first thing they did they buy a new house for him. When he started to work there he didn't have any problems. He felt like his dreams came true. He never had any money problems. And he also had enough money to help his parent. His parent were really proud of their son and happy for him. From there on he didn't have any money problems. In addition one type of job I would employ would be a soldier because want to protect people in the country. Once there was a girl named Generic_Name. Generic_Name lived with his father and mother, but she didn't have any siblings. Generic_NameGeneric_Name's father was a soldier. Generic_Name really loved being a soldier, but her parent didn't let her be because in their country girls weren't allowed to fight on wars. One day a soldier came to Generic_Name's home and told Generic_Name's father that there was war in their town, so they needed him. But Generic_Name father couldn't go because he was really sick. And the problem was he only had one child, and she was girl. Generic_Name's father wanted to go but Generic_Name stopped him because he was very sick, and she didn't want her father to die, and she also didn't want their town to be destroyed Generic_Name decided to go to fight by her self. When she was on her way to the soldiers she decided to pretend to be a boy because she knew that if she shows her self as a girl the general will send her back to her father's house. When she got there Generic_Name trained for the war, she was so ready to fight. The general told them to get ready for the war so that when the enemies come they start to shoot them first. But the other group planned a awful way to finish them so when they got there they were all shoot by the enemies except for Generic_Name. She fought all the enemies, and they were all died. But when she finished she was so tired she felt down and slept. When she was asleep the fake hair dropped. When the soldiers came they were so happy but when they saw her they were surprise.``A girl she's a girl," one of the soldiers said. When the general came he was so angry that wanted to give the other soldiers perdition to kill her, but he remembered that she helped them won the first war, so he decided to let her go home and never come back. One day the enemies surrounded the soldiers, and they were all attacked. The news was all over the place. The villagers were so afraid because they didn't have anyone to protect them. Generic_Name didn't want their general to die, so she planned something. She went to the enemies secretly. She killed all of their enemies, and then she went to their captain. ``Your highness I know the person who wanted to kill you," she said. ``He said that he is not afraid of you, and he is waiting for you your highness," she said. ``Do you know where that person is now?," Asked the captain. ``Yes, and he said he's waiting for you, "She said. ``Take me there," Said the captain.``OK, " She said. So she took the general outside. But when the general got there he didn't see anybody. ``Where is the person?," the general asked.``I am the person," Generic_Name said. At first the general laugh and laugh but when they started fighting. The general died and the people didn't have any problems. And from that day on Generic_Name was accepted to be a soldier and everybody respected her. One job that I would like to work to would be a soldier because I want to get a lot of money and I also want to help the citizen just like Generic_Name did. At first Generic_Name thought that being a nurse was the right thing for him but when he stepped to soldier he didn't have any problems about money and his poor family now lives good life because of their child is a soldier. At first the general thought that girls can not help on the war but Generic_Name wanted to prove it, and she proved that women too are strong enough to be soldiers. DearManager I would like to employ for soldier because it is a good way to protect other people, and it has a lot of money. Some people think that only men can work on soldier work but if you believe that you're wrong because soldier work is for all of us not only for men. If you're a woman, and you want to be a soldier just do it is doesn't matter what type of person you are.
