Albert Einstein said" Imagination is more important that knowledge" do I agree with Albert Einstein or do I disagree I picked agree, and I'm going to tell you why I picked it. Reason one imagination is all about being creative like thinking about stuff to do and stuff to wear and writing a song you got to use your imagination and speaking you got to use your imagination just to know what your about to say before you even say the word. Reason two Albert Einstein used his imagination to be really smart and creative. Also people who invented stuff they used their imagination and not only that they made millions just by using there imagination, and construction workers got to use their own imagination just to construct a big buildings and houses. Reason three you can make money from just using your imagination I have seen people make lots of money just selling stuff they made at their own homes and seen so many companies go from not making anything like money to being this really large company that made millions just from using there imagination. And that's why I agree with Albert Einstein saying "Imagination is more important than knowledge"
