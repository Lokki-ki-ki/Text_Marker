People say, having a positive attitude is the key to a success in life. I strongly agree with them, if you come to think about it been positive may give you the courage to do subtend things. You would believe in yourself and most possible make your goals come true. It also would be hard for you to get your feelings hurt. People won't be able to brake you down that easily. So in my personal opinion, having a positive attitude actually is the key to a success in life. When I said it gives you the courage to do subtend things I mean it. Because, you might want to make a goal in you life come true, but your probably to shy or you're thinking "oh there's no way I'm going to make it".That's the main problem, you have a negative energy witch bring you to have a negative action. Sometimes your words reflect your actions. This is why I think if you have a positive attitude you will success in life. Been positive or having a positive energy is like the meaning of "faith".Let's talk about why I mention "faith". Having faith makes you believe in yourself'When you have a negative attitude your of course going to have a negative action. But in many religions if you have faith everything is possible. This is why I compare these two words, that are very similar to each other. So if you have "Faith" you must have a positive attitude. Having a positive attitude can help you out emotional too. If your positive at all times no matter what people say about you, it won't hurt you as bad. The reason i believe it won't hurt you as bad is because, you would believe in your self and won't let other negative attitude ruin yours. For example, if I say to myself "Man i already know i ain't going to pass this test, i ain't even going to try". Oviosly I'm going to fail because, having a negative energy reflects not to even try. So if you want to success in life like I do, you should try to change your attitude and try been positive at all times.
