How to distribute forty work hours a week most usefully? Nowadays, a four-day work week is very rare, because this system is new; people always being careful when something new come out, but then they understand it is better. The four-day schedule is more balanced, energy and money saving and variable. This is why, I believe, our school should follow the new schedule. First, the forty-day school week is more well-distributed, because the students would have more time for rest, doing homework; so their ability to study will have been raised. On another hand, ten hours in school might be exhausting for the pupils, but the school administration may make breaks longer and more frequent to solve the problem of tired studentsSecond, the four-day schedule lowers the use of energy and resources. The school would use less electricity to heat and cool the building; it will spend less money for servicing the students and investigate saved money to science researches, equipment and study program development. Third, with the sour-day schedule the pupils become more free: they might share more time with their family and friends; spent more time for their hobbies and working. The students may hardly learn if they are late for making project or plan the interesting and fun weekend in the three days; the bad thing about rest four days: you will not rest. School days will be very busy, hard; but maybe more educational and efficient. Long ten hours in school might be uncomfortable for the students, who do extra curriculum activities like preparing courses, art clubs and sports. However, our school has all comfort abilities to do extra curriculum activities inside the school's building, so the students do not need to go anywhere else. To conclude, the four-day school week seems experimental for people yet; but when something new is thought the people realize an idea is innovative, then the idea becomes an action, which becomes regular.
