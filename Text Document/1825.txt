Do you know that 80% of students that goes to the after school program and received more extra help succeeded more than the students who didn't go? After school program helps students that need more help to succeed, pulls up students grades, and they will have extra time to complete missing work and home works. If a student wasn't available in a class and missed the class lesson;They would have the opportunity to stay after school with their teachers and learn what they missed and complete their missing work that they haven't done in class. Students stay after to study with their friend and teacher for the test and receive help on difficult lessons by that grades will increase for students that will make them succeed in the future. And it's a better way for teachers to explain the lesson without interrupting the class and make other students confused. Having you missing work done at school might be hard to do in classes but by having the after school program you will have the time to complete them with your teacher and your friends and taking more help by asking the teacher about what you don't understand? Sometimes some students needs more time completing the tests or the quizzes so the only way to complete them is staying after, so they won't lose points and grades. On the other hand some students think that staying after is a waist of time, and you won't receive any benefits, and some don't care if they have missing work or classes they missed, but it's all wrong staying after is a much better way for pulling grades up it's a huge opportunity that teachers give their own time to their students by complete missing work, making the teacher explain the lesson again to the students to make them understand the lesson and what it's talking about, so they won't be confused or fail the class. In retrospect after schools programs is big good opportunity that most schools provide for students to receive that extra help from teachers to complete what their missing to make students succeed in school and pull up their grades that's why we should persuade students to go after school for help, that's why I'm base with school programs.
