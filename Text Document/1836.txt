To conserve energy and resources, some business have adopted a four-day work week, with each day consist of ten hours. In my opinion, this idea would bring benefits for some students and disadvantages too. For example the students who really like the school it would be a great idea, to be dog team-progets or just spend time with friends and teachers. In the other hand some students don't really like to be 8 hours in the school, so I just realize that they would not agree with that idea. A mayor percent of the students to don't like school, decide to quit or just apply to an elective school. Like in my case almost 1 year ago I decide to start going to an elective school, the reason is that I work a full TME job after school, and it was difficult to arrive on time every day to the basic school. I think the idea of adding 2 hours more to the schedule of the basic school is not a good idea, because students who are in the high school and have a job as a part-time or even a full time would decide to apply to a basic school. I mean a basic school is better for the students who work at the same time they can make their schedule smaller and have enough time to sleep, work, and to study. In conclusion, this is my point of view.
