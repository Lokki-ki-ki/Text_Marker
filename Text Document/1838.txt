The Former British Prime Minister Winston Church Hill once said that" Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm." I agree with Church Hill because, some people do fail multiple times, but they keep doing it until they get it. British Prime Minister Winston Church Hill was from WWII to help the British to fight with the Germans on war. He helps people in his country and America too. Church Hill gave a speech that said" Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm." Think that people fail on and on that he is mighty think that some people can do it when they need to do. Church Hill the Prime Minister of Great Britain wanted the people to know that you're not the only one that fail all the time. Others people are the same as you and you're not alone. He says that we can do it even if we keep trying and trying that it will happen soon for you. That you are responsible to your own work and responsible on your own. Church Hill might? Be the same as us in our life. He might deal with the same problem as us in our life. Even tho he work in the government with other smart people, but he can be the same issues. He wants people to know that your not alone you have others to help you in your problems and issues on yourself and others. He wants people to know that your not alone you have others to help you in your problems and issues on yourself and others will help you in life.
