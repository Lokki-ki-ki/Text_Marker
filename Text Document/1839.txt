I'll talk about to disagree in many causes I have been paired with people who are bad they have their bad character, they are aggressive, discriminator, impulsive, in that aspect, however, one is at risk while being with bad people they even try to do things to one, for example they beat him, they mistreat him, they require him, to do bad things such as killing, rooting, selling drugs, and much more in those causes, they usually happen bad today there is much evil sim embark they try to undo others by giving them bad ideas so that they run the risk just as they do. But what really who harm what the please through a Machiavellian emotional black mail based of fear of aggression but under certain circumstances, evil acts can occur without the need of all of us. We have met people who appear to be kind while they gain their trust and that is when you realize that you are failing that you have been linked to bad people even in recent years, bad people there are people who have an evil background because of their environment can shape us to detect bad people, the occurrence of very media tic cases of under or abuse of people make society silvery high because there are such people bad. The virtues are the qualities we have and that provides a good for the same and for others is to say not knowing how to live with another in my case, terrible things usually happen to me when I talked to my aunt, I didn't know that she was aggressive discriminating well, not only does it happen to me, I have seen more people who go through terrible things that even their own family is bad with on in case it is terrible to happen with bad people influence. Aperson with whom, spoke and through the times, realized that he would be badly took him out of school so that the child would be unable to read and would fail to steal in stores how bad it is why he closed the doors and I take that great opportunity away from the boy now the boy is a boy, who is in perdition, because how his own mom did every thing to him now he is a bad boy who is stealing is aggressive all because of her mother's fault why she took that great opportunity from the boy. That is why today there is so much evil because many and others were separated from their relatives making is not only one of the most bad people the propensity to the evil of these children is in the way it is conformed to detect so much evil today full give people with the smile in the month and the poison in the heart.
