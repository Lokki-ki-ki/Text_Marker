During years had been existed a question among be yourself and be like the people wants you to be; in this time I agree with the author when he says," to be yourself is the greatest accomplishment in this world that is trying constantly to make you someone else," because there is a lot of people that shows indifference with you, only because of the way you think, or for simple things like how you wear, the music you like, or how you like to live. Be yourself is one of the best things that exists in this world, because you don't have to act different in front of the other people just to be accepted, one of the advantages to be yourself is, if you are loved by someone for how you are, you don't be afraid to hurt that person because of your bad actions. Otherwise, we also can get benefits for being how the world wants you to be, for example in your job, you are getting pay for all your effort working hard, although you want to do it or not. Nevertheless, in this world we away are controlled by someone no matter what. Beliefs, the law, or parents; and it's necessary to be controlled because they are teaching us how we have to be in a good way. Although there are obstacles that are trying to not let you be yourself, always is better no matter what is in front of you, it feels comfortable without conceal of nobody, that's why I think to be yourself is the greatest accomplishment.
