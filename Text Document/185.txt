I think that the curfew is good idea for adopting because at least students will not dying on the streets, and they will not be no loneliness for them. Teens would not brake the law if they were not in big trouble. For teens there will be no street fights, crime, shooting weapons, etc. The curfew will take care of them at least temporary, or it depends. Government needs to take care of homeless teens. Those who drop high school early is too bad because some students decided do not learn and try hard their subjects. They will not success in future without education. In real world no one need them because they are not educated, did not complete high school and there are take care by themselves on the streets. After curfew, they're leaving, found minimum job with payment good for them, at least teens did something in their life. Their big mistake that ignore, lazy, skiing school, worse grades, attitude, not respect, self phone etc. If teens will not change their minds, possibility well end up in wrong way. But I hope that they will succeed in the future.
