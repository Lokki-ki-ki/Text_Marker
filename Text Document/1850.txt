Well I think an enjoyable way to spend time outdoors is with your family and friends making some hamburgers, hot dogs, care Masada, tacos, and barbacoa. Play games like soccer, football ride a bike, make running races with your friends, or baseball, play music but not so loud because the police may come, invite you son/daughter boyfriend/girlfriend and their parents to come to the park, maybe bring some snacks for the afternoon. Spending time outdoors with your family and friends is like having a camping day, is there is a river that you are allowed to fish, it will be a great idea to go fish and catch some fish to eat them, but the most important thing is to have fun with all your friends and family. To admire how beautiful is the nature, to forget all your problems while listening to the sound of the birds reconnect with you family and to remember how important is to the love of your family and friends, Because some people don't have family and friends and there are all alone that's why is so important how much the people around you that appreciate you so much, and you have to be so thankful for that. In the night you can make fire to put mash mellow to the fire and then eat them with cookies one on top and the other one on the bot on and while eating the mash mellow the people can make a large group to tell scary story maybe some jokes but the best at the end the best part of being outdoors is the are having fun with your friend and family, but also you are breathing fresh air from the nature. Community parks, state parks, and national parks are very important for the community because is a place where someone can have fun while there are with their friends, with their boyfriend/girlfriend, or with their wife/husband you can make a party, you can go run, walk with your dog or just take a walk to relax your brain and reflationary and to forget about all your problems for just a moment and I think parks are place that we have to take care of because that's where are the home of some birds animals and plants to grow.
