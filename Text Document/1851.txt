Can we accomplish more if we are always doing something ? Sometimes we are lazy, and we don't want to do nothing, but if we are doing always something we can be stronger and helpful to the citizen. Sometimes we are lazy, but that is bad in our life because we have to learn about this life and prepare for the future and other things. One day we would grow up, and we would do not know anything, and we're gonna fall in our life, therefor I told them this advice. Thomas Jefferson wrote, "Determine never to be idle...it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."we can be stronger if we are always doing something because we can learn about everything that we did, and we can get strength to be better, also we can be an adviser to other peoples for example: Kids, Teenager, also Adults. We can be helpful if we are always doing something because one day that we fall down, also we can stand up stronger and healthy. We can help person with our experiences, also we can help kids give them an advice because we want a good, strong citizen in this world, and they can make it better, and help each other. In conclusion, we can be stronger, healthy for people that don't know anything in this life. We can do better things for our future, furthermore kids will be our future, therefore we are gonna fight for them, and their future because if we are lazy, and we don't do anything we are going to fail. We need more activities in our life and do something all the time because for that we can learn ah be adviser, also we need a break, but we have to continue learning and to be success in our life, and complete our dreams.
