People believe that students should take music or drama class and I am agree with them because some students like to play instruments and some of them like to enjoy drama events and a lot of students like to draw even if they're not good drawing, but they try and that's why they should take art class and the same thing with students who likes to play instruments. But the problem is if a student want to take those classes they have to ask for a permission from their parents first, because a lot of students want to take the class but their parents they don't agree with their children and also sometimes to take those classes its need time and some kids don't have compassion to take it easy, and they ruined it. But many students love to play instruments, and they usually give their time on it, and they learn with time practicing. For example, A lot of students like to play sports for school, and they talk with their parents first if they can play and also, if the parents agree with their children decision and the same thing with music class, drama,art etc. Because for this kind of stuff always need time. But I am agree with people who believe that students should have required to take music, drama and art class because they can learn something new in their life and someday they can find a job to be an artistic or musician to play song in any events and drama they can get to record for the TV shows and that will be a good job for them in the future. Those people who think that students should take classes for music, art,drama they support their children that's why they want their kids to take it and that's the good thing because they give the permission and an opportunity to their children to learn.
