There is lots of way to use hyperbola. What does Romania mean? It's a sound affect you would see when you are reading a book or watching a cartoon here are some examples for this word the owl whoosh away flying as quick whoosh is a sound affect when watching a cartoon you could have seen the character falling then you see the word boom when he falls. People really get confused with simile or metaphor when they see it or and persona faction and hyperbola it almost means the same thing, but they are not. Romania it the easiest but hard to write half of the people that first start to learn this have a hard time one. Saying it's name or two. Writing it because for sure I did. What is simile? Well simile is when there is like or as in it there are ways like he is as sad as the clouds there are two things they are comparing it too, and it has as but metaphor could have as or like in it but still wouldn't be a simile. You could say as I was walking I stumble across an old friend of mine your using as in the sentence that's a metaphor. It is important for you to know this so when you are reading or watching t. v or something this lesson will remind you about what you just learned. Persona faction is a long and confusing word, but the meaning for this long word is almost the same as hyperbola you all already know what's the meaning but persona fiction is used in sentences like the clouds don't look very happy they look mad the meaning for this is that it looks like it's about to rain. Really tricky to not get hyperbola or persona faction correct.
