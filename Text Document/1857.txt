I think the acted of kindness can effect someone I guess does affect someone it depends on who they are how they feel, their story kindness is something we should all do be kind to others. Being kind to someone can make you feel great some people are not kind because maybe what they have gone through in their past, but kind can be something more than just the word kind, sure kind can be being nice to someone, but some people can think that the act of kindness means something Elsa to someone. When I hear what the act o kindness means like being nice to someone be best friends with someone being friends with so many people you should never let anyone be alone the act of kindness can be overact of kindness everyone has well not everyone but I know that in side of everyone there is a little bet of kindness I feel the people that have more kindness are the people that I guess they have been with people like being someone's best friend those two best friends have been with each other there whole life yeah they might fight but i think when they are friends again it's nice that means to me that in them, they care about them, they have kindness in them people wish they have people that cared about them where kind to they that why I say that the act of kindness can effect some people not all do I also think that some people do not get affected by it because people got hurt by someone and that's what i tank of the act of kindness.
