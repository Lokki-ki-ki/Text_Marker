I agree that it's hard to Impressions is impossible to change because my First experiences and the example is that when I was 16 and my first day of working with my uncle and I work on delivered marble, materials to the person who needed something to fixing the problem As a result on my first day and experiences it went well and OK because I was a little nervous that something is going to be wrong that I may say something wrong and I don't know what to do when the person say you got the one material and tools. On my second day at work my boss told me to go help the other workers and I did and I grab the big marble table and put it on the truck and tied the rope and rap tightly, so it won't fell down but when I was going to jump out of the truck and rope was ripping apart, and the table got broke in half the consequently that means we clean the mess and throw it away and grab another marble to cut it in a right shape and size and delivered and fast as we can to make it one time and that is one of my scary experiences because I was scared that my boss will get mad at me and the other workers is a good thing that we work together to finish the job and the mistake we had to fix. And boss tell my dad that he did a good job and impression like his dad use to do my Father was very proud that did very well at work for the past 3 days because I work there for 5 hours and very fun and a good experience, and they teach me out to use the tool the right way and how to use it properly and those people help me a lot and a pleasure to work there on the marble shop as a worker and made few new friends and that job.
