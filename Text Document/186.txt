I think we are accomplished more if we are always do in something, Because if you doing was you have to be doing you going to get your stuff done. Because when you don't do was you have to do you don't DET nothing done, then you're going to be worried because you didn't get our work done.my second reason is if you get your stuff done you can get a free time when you do all your work, and it fells so good finishing all you work that you had. When you're done you not going to be tired.
