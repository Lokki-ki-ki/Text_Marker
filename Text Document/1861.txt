I have heard that many people gets bully by others' people sometimes, and which does I don't understand, why this it happens probably for the color of you're skin, and we all are the same just the color of the skin is different. Or can be other reason why they bully other people, which is people who get bully they could kill themselves about getting bullied by other ones and that's a bad situation. But those bad people they keep on bulling they don't stop until something happens, and I ask my self why? This sometimes happens, probably It's because we are different from they are, or they feel stronger than other ones or can be any other reason probably they are rich they have more money than other people, probably that's why bulling someone is not nice it could cause bad things to you. And I understand that it's hard for those people who are suffering about bulling, and It's hard to support all that when you get bullied for someone, when you bullied I think k is not for some reason and its horrible for those people who get bullied by someone, I think that's something that those people who are bulling they should stop bulling those poor people. What should we do about bulling collaborate to stop we should stop because, it can cause bad situation to those people who are bulling other they can go to jail for the reason they make fun of others, why they can go jail because those poor people who are getting bullied they could kill themselves and that's why they can go to jail it's a bad thing that's what can happen to them if they don't stop bulling
