I agree that some district offer programs that allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of 4, some students don't have enough money, or they don't want to go to college. Their parents work day and night if they got out of high school with a diploma they will be able to work full time and help their parents with money or even move out of the house and start living independently, another reason is that teenagers would be more mature for their ages and learn everything they need to know to be successful in life.Nowadays, employees are looking for young adults to work for them but also with experience, that means if students graduates in three years they could gain experience by working on a restaurant, store et in one year. Other teenagers will go to college or university if they know what they want to study and know what they want to be, they will graduate at a good age not young, but not that old, they would have more time, energy, and interest. Some teenagers just don't want to be at school for years they don't like school, this program help them have more time to experience, try new things, prepare them for what they want to do and how they want to do it.
