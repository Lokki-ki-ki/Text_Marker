As I know the Music, Drama, and Art classes are not mandatory to take. The leaders at education area can take these classes for their choices. Infact it is an elective not mandatory. So the leaders can take these subject as an elective. For example: if a student take an art class in fact he/she is not take it as a required class he/she take it for their choice and wants to get extra credit. Or if a person has 4 required classes and he/she take an art class instead one of the 4 classes and he/she thought this is the 4 classes that I need for graduation indeed they are going to take a wrong class because as we know the art classes is not needed for graduation. So we have to take a class that we needed for graduation. Although some educators take the art or music classes off course seniors because they might have fewer classes. In this case they choose these classes as choice and the junior can take these as well to get extra credit.let's talk about the required classes:require classes are: English11,geometry, math,CIS, world history,etc...these classes that students need to take it and complete the school credit and received a better score for graduation. Each subject has different SOL test. When the students reach to those classes they need to pass the SOL test as well as SOL is one of the important part of required classes that leaders need to pass it during a year. The SOL test comes twice for students off course!they have to received over 300 score which can allowed to take it again. So that is the required classes which is a student learn in a year. Although we have an electives classes such is Art, Drama Music etc, but we can not count on required classes. So Art, Drama, and Music are not necessary to take it as required classes those should be electives that leaders can choose as favorite subject for their future.
