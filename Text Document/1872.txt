Should students take the programs that the school district is offering, which is to allow student to graduate high school in only three years instead of taking full four years. It is clear that finishing high school in just three years can be the best opportunity. One can be to get high school out of the way. Not everyone likes high school year, therefore it is the great way to graduate early and accomplish to get into your dream college school. This program that let you take courses during the summer can be a great option to finish high school quickly, the aim of this study is to, so students get out of high school, and have enough time to start processing and think about what want to do in college or start working to help out their parents on necessary things, such as, bills, rent, etc. However, not all students would take this action, it emphasized that students may not have time, it can affect their sleep schedule, and not completing school. Some, of course, may think that you're not learning fulfilling, for instance, regular school year is like ten months and if one take the programs, you're only taking extra courses during the whole summer, that's like saying you're missing a whole ten months of school. In addition, if I were to take this program, I would really do as much as I can during the summer courses, and courses to get extra credits that I need for the colleges that Iâ€™m applying to. And soon I'll start working, and apply for a scholarship, also applying to universities or colleges that I would like to attend to, In conclusion, many people may not agree or join the programs, we all have different opinions, different beliefs, this program can help many students to start off thinking majors, work, so, I'd recommend students to take this offer, and see where it can take you. I can assure one can accomplish something for their goal in the future.
