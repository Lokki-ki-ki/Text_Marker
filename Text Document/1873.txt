I think that finish high school in three year is a perfect idea, because I can go early to the college, and I don't lost time. One reason is my friend Generic_Name, who finish high school early, and now he's done with college; Additional, he says that finish high school is very good because he got more time to work but not everyone thinks like him. Therefor my others friends who think that is not good, because they need go prepared to the college, so they say if I finish early high school I can't go prepared to the college; Another reason is that nobody want lost time, for that reason my friend Generic_Name finish high school early, but many youngest are lazy. Every school need offer that program, the program is really important because can help a lot of students to finish high school early; Also, a lot student want finish early. I think that everyone need to take the program, because the students got more time to work, and to learn too, so the program is a big help for the students who take it. My friend Generic_Name ad others friends who I know, they are benefit. One year is a long time, in one year early they can get more money and more everything.
