I agree with Author Emerson because people can do what they think makes them happy, they will support what they believe in without fearing anything, and they will speak up for themselves. Emerson's quote is saying that we live in a world with many influences trying to change who you are, so to retain your individuality or who you are is a great magnanimous feature. Most people end up striving to change themselves to fit standards to portrayed by media or to try to impress someone, however I think that people who choose not to change, and to be themselves are the accomplished ones. Other people will be inspired to become like you if you exceed to be yourself and not care what others think of you, and you should do what makes you comfortable. By you going against what everyone thinks is normal, you are showing that you are happy about who you are, and you will stand out, out of all the other people trying to be someone they are not. I know some people might disagree with me, but that's ok everyone has their own opinion.
