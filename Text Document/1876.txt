Some people don't accomplish their work when they are doing something because if they are then they might not have time to do the other work they are given, or they might be busy with the hard work first then maybe finish the work. But inactivity also serve as a purpose because some people aren't doing anything, so they have time to finish and accomplish something because they are not doing anything first reason that inactivity should serve as a purpose is because people that aren't doing anything should be able to accomplish their work and other work so that they did not finish and they don't have an excuse to not do work. On the other hand people doing work have an excuse because if they are given a lot for work they might not have time to finish the other work but the people that finish working and have some time left should be given more work in till they're done have any more time at school or at work. The first reason why people accomplish something when they are doing something is because they work and don't waste time at school or work but sometime. The second reason is that they don't accomplish work when they are doing something because they won't have time to finish the other work, or they rush and make a lot of mistakes on their work and will get a bad report are grade on it so that's why some people don't accomplish their work when they are doing other things. So inclusion some people accomplish their work and some don't also inactivity serve as a purpose for people that are done with their work but class, or they are still work should not just sit there and do nothing they should get more work in till they leave the class or their jobs.
