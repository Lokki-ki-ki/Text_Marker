World is change every second. Each year grow tree. But people cut trees faster. Some people say to be successful in our life person need to be yourself. But, why? Be yourself is the best way to be successful. But most of the people don't know, how be successful? They think that to have money they will be successful. For example, peoples try to be IT programmers, because someone say that they earn more money. But most people don't know what it is and in this area most people are new. Their don't want work and their work are looks not good. After a couple time, they left this job and they're trying something else. Only couple of them stay on this area. Another example is students. This year some students will be grated, and they don't come back to school again. Nobody doesn't ask "Does student want to go to school?". And this is one of the reason, why students don't want to go to school. But, those years that he was in school, he will be reminded. Most people don't know what will be after four years. Students go to college which say their parents. Most of us to survive in this life doing that he or she doesn't want. Most immigrants come to rich countries because they have money. They learn their native language just to have more money. One person say "Make your job what you want to do, and you wouldn't work, never". We don't think how we can be successful? And it's make wrong decision. People think that be painter or artist is bad, because they don't have much more money. This mind is wrong. Artists are being not bad because they live by yourself. To find yourself is hard because it takes time and other people influence to other people. But when person find yourself his or her life will be happy. Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, "To be yourself in world is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment"I agree, because yourself it's make life better.
