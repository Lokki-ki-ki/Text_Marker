Have you ever grouped up with older or younger students before? And you think of each other's differently and won't work it out, well there a program that helps older and younger to solve that problem. Older students can teach the younger students to learn the next year problems or tests that is coming up. The younger students would confuse how do the problems in front of them and would need helps. The older students help the younger students with their studies. Older students can help them read the sentences on the problems they have or help with the steps of the problem. The younger students can help the older students what they learned and teach them how the problems works again. A lot of older students forgot what they learned in the past, and it's stressful. In sixth grade, my teacher lets all sixth grades read with 2nd graders, and it's how younger and older bonds little. The younger and older students can bond each other in the program. They can learn from each other what they do in their own grades to lighten up the day without awkwardness. It's a teamwork program that helps younger and older students to assist for each other. It's like a group project, and they have to work with each other to finish the project and helps each other step by step. One time I was little an older student away read to me, and slowly we bonded, It was nice at the end of the day. Bonding is a key to success of learning from each other, and we are the same person with different thoughts and mind.
