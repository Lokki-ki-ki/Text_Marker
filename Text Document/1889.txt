I agree what Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote about. I agree with him because if you do the same thing you Mastered you will never grow but if you do more things, and then you mastered you will grow a lot. You need to have a lot of experience and be on top of everything, so you can grow. I'll give you an example if you have a concrete company that you mastered you will be okay. If you sell concrete and do Excavation and commercial your company can grow a lot, and you will do more what you Mastered and can grow a lot from that. You need to have a lot of ideas and experiences what you are doing. If you think you can do something or achieve more do it because you can grow a lot from doing that. It's good to have experience and knowledge because everything can go away in seconds if you don't care of it. It's always good to do more what you Mastered in life. Furthermore, it's good to do more what you mastered, so you can grow a lot. I really do agree with Emerson and what he wrote is so true.
