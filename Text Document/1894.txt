I agree with Churchill statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success because if I felt the ESL, my feeling is to think positive and there are many students that can't graduate, and they put all the energy to pass the classes. If I felt the ESL, my feeling is to think positive. Many students fail ESL but they never give up. There is no easy to pass ESL, but you have to put all the effort to do it right. Many students think positive and put all the energy to passed. There are many students that can't graduate, and they put all the energy to pass the classes. Some students study too much and never loss the enthusiasm to pass the classes and be graduate's peoples. Students put all the energy to graduate because they want to have a career for in a future to be a better people. Many students put all the focus in class to can be graduates.Others said many peoples fail and fail and don't put the interest to get ahead. Some peoples preferred to work and don't finish the high school because they pass only failing the class and loss the enthusiasm to get ahead. There are many peoples that loss the interest to be better peoples because they are torn to fail each time. I think many peoples that fail they lost the interest to be betters in a future because they are bored to pass to the same thing aver time and preferring to don't get ahead.
