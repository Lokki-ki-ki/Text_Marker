I disagree to school board adding an half hour to school each day. I think is bad because adding another half hour to takes time away from there family, and it takes to be with there family. Some children do not have time to see their family in the week days because there mom or dad comes home after they are going to sleep or before they go to school but maybe Fridays to Sundays is when they can see their family. Some students don't have time to say a few hours because some students have sports to do, or they are going do something else at home or have to go see the doctor. If they add a half hour to the school system I think all most all the student will not come to school half of the school year. I disagree to the school board adding a half hour to school each day. I have been to school all year except when I have to go the doctor for cheek up that is the only time I miss school. Furthermore, I play sports, so I do not have time say a little bet longer of school, or I am not on the term anymore. To sum up I think school should be some as it is or take sum time of school because is too long to add time to it. All in all school help as to learn.
