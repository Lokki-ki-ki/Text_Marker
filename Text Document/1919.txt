How the humans use the technology. The technology in the world is change all time or each year, sometime people use the phone with excessive time; practically we live on red social. The cellphone it's the first device that the humans use more time in the world. How we can see at the pass to the years the technology advance to fast around to the world, and thanks to the technology we forget how is the content in a book; in my personal opinion is happens. I think that the technology was some revolutionary for the humanity because the technology come to make the life easier to the humans in the world. We are blinds because we prefer pass more time in the phone than pass more time with our family, we dedicate our time in red social, where only we are lost the time. In conclusion the technology was a benefit very important in the humanity, we need to learn how use the internet with responsibility, and understand how the technology change the world; like help us to care the planet, but I think we are done the against because we are lost our time all thanks at the reds socials, we need to know that the technology is a creation of the human to do the life easier in the world. All what I can say is thanks to my ante past for creating the technology that today in day I use for my benefit, each day I learn something new thanks to the technology.
