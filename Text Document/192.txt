Dear principal, I am very honored to write to you this letter and I pray you take time from your busy schedule and read this letter.I hope you are doing good as I am here.I also want to say that I am happy to be a student in your school.first I take a stand on your decision of changing the school food to a very healthier one and say it a very good one.it's a very thoughtful idea, and it's also showing that you love the school and I appreciate you for such a great idea. It's a good idea because, half of the student have allergic reaction to some food the chief's cook, so they rather go hungry or have an empty stomach and if such incident still goes on, student might even pass out one day. Secondly, if we get healthier food, we will be active and our brains will be able to function well as soon as class start. However, having a good breakfast or even any good food to begin your day sometimes help the brain to work very well, and it's also helped make the brain be in a very good position of working during the day. And not only does it work for the brain, it's also consist or contain some particular minerals like carbohydrate, protein, and fat and other supplementary substance that also help for human growth and also help give energy to the human body. Lastly, changing the school food will also will make student that has never tried the school lunch will now want to try it. Moreover, some student order food and have it deliver to the school all because they do not like the school food or allergic to certain food, and if such incident keeps happening, the school food will go waste, and it's will make the school loose money.so, I will end my speech by saying that it's a very good and a nice decision for having to change the school food to a healthier one .once again I hope you take time from your busy schedule and read this letter.
