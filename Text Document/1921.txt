Dear principal I am writhing this letter, to prove your opinion about changing the school menu because is something good for the school and for the student, to try something different, and something healthier, some student would like the idea of changing the food menu because they have been eating the same food over the first day of school, and others would not like the idea of changing the menu because they already have they favorite food, but most of the student would be happy, to change the food menu to something better, and it is a good idea, because some student don't eat at the school lunch, instead they go outside the school to buy food at the restaurant, and others make they on food at home to bathed at the school, in my opinion it will be better to try something new to see what it would happened in the future and how the student would react on the change of the lunch menu, instead of eating the same food every year of school, it and be a bad thing or a good idea changing the school menu for example it may be worse and student would don't like it, or it can't be good and more student would eat the school lunch.
