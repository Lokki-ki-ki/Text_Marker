Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is something you know, imagination is anything you want to see. When you were a kid you had imagination it was with you when you were born, knowledge you have to learn. With imagination, you can believe anything, new ideas are made with imagination, imagination is fun. You can believe anything you want with imagination. What is imagination? It's something you imagine for example an imaginary friend. Something not real but you see it no one else can see your imagination. You can make your brain think whatever you want you control it. You want to believe your touching a teddy bear, then you just imagine it and feel it. Our imagination is in our brains with us, it's something you're born with something only you can see it, feel it, and only you can imagine it. Ideas happen because of imagination you can think of new ideas for a movie or anything. Some people just have a bigger imagination then us, but we all think unique. Everything we have in earth is because imagination happened. Those people think "what do we need, what can help me." First you have to imagine it, then you have to believe, and finally you do it. Imagination is fun just let it take you where ever you want. It's something you're born with not something you learn. Take vantage of it. That's why I think Imagination is more important than knowledge. You have it with you, you just need to let it shine. Just image anything. Don't be afraid to show your imagination. Just do it and keep imaging, your imagination can take you anywhere you want.
