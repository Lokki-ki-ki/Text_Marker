Something I want to accomplish in the future is to play on a professional soccer team. I want to accomplish this because soccer is my main sport, If I had a chance to play in a professional soccer team it would be amazing. One specific team is Barcelona, Because Barcelona is one of the best soccer team in the world winning a lot of trophies. They won the champion five time, they also won "La Copa del Rey." Barcelona they got a lot of good players they got Messi, pike,ANSI fate, Luis Shares, and Friedman. I'm a Barcelona fan if I had I chance to play for Barcelona it would be a dream come true for me. I would be so happy for the rest of my life playing as a professional soccer player. And one last thing I also want to play for my country as a professional soccer player. Because my country is not good they have lost to many other countries, but they haven't won any game, so I want to change that. I want to make my country win a lot of game not just getting destroy by other country. I want somebody that can change the way they play I want they to play in a good way. The player who is going to change how my country plays is me. I want to change how they play I don't want my country loosing a lot of game my country need to win a lot of game. One day I will accomplish that I would be the player who change my country but not just win game, win the World Cup for the first time in History of my country. That would be a dream come true again, and then Avery person in the team is going to be happy about winning the World Cup.
