I believe Thomas Jefferson is right. If we are always doing something we get things done faster and there is possibilities of starting new things. Why should we wait to finish something we can finish the same day, we never know what can happen. I also believe the inactivity is good not only does it give a chance to rest, but we also can think through our ideas. We can perfect things we didn't think we could. It can give a chance to see different views of are own ideas. Maybe taking a break can refresh are memories and remind us how important things are to us. Working all the time can exhausted ours bodies and make us think a little less. With a fresh mind set it can make things easier than we thought. Sometimes we overthinks that aren't that big of a deal and a big part of it comes from not taking the time to rest and refresh our memories. Many people would agree with Thomas Jefferson just like I do but would also agree that taking time to rest is also getting things done.
