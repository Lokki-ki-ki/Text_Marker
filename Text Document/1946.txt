This is a very good prompt to write about but I might have to agree on this because if you keep failing in life, and sometimes you get bored with it you might have to change your mind and be success. Because falling in life is not that easy for same people. But sometimes people might disagree it because if you fail you can't be successful in life, and if you are trying to get a job, and you keep failing on what the boss is asking you to do you might not get the job. Even thought in school you can't keep failing. I also agree with Churchill's statement because you can't just success in life without trying because life is very hard to success in it. And if you want to be success you really have to try in life, there's so many people in life that don't have jobbed, place to sleep or food to eat because they did not success in life. Success also consists of going from failure to failure because sometimes in life you have to fail, no one in life have success from the day they were born. My conclusion is that failure can lead you to success.
