Some people think that is more beneficial working alone that working in group. Which I disagree with for two reasons: People always need help and is more beneficial working in group. I feel that the benefits come from others. The first reason is that we as a human being, we need help. When we are working, we need help from others at work, during class at school, anywhere where we work. For example, at work when I'm cooking I also need someone that can brings the ingredients. Some would argue that, working in group don't help you to learn, but we learn from others not from ourselves. As a result, we obtain help from others working as a group. Additionally, we obtain benefits working in groups. In addition, benefits to us are made it from others, benefits to others are made it from us. To illustrate, when I'm sick, and I can't go to work I need someone to change his scheduled, and take my place, for that day, so he is going to need the same benefit from me to cover him one day he gets be sick, or will have any emergency. Some may say that working in group is not beneficial, working in a group we acquired more benefits than working alone. As a result working in groups give us the chance to have more benefits. It's obvious that, working is groups is more beneficial this will allow us to get the help need it from others, and to have more benefits made it by others. We should always work in groups, helping each other as a human being.
