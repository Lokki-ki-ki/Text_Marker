I agree with Mr Ralph waldo that To be Yourself in a world full of fake people is a great accomplish, No matter what you do for other people they will always treat you like a piece of garbage, So What's The point of Pretending to be someone that's not me. I Prefer to be Myself and be happy Then, Pretend to be someone else just to make people like me, people will like me for the way I am and not for whom I'm Pretending to be so that I don't have to waste my time hanging out with fake friends. I know people that are a shame of where they came from, and they started forgetting their culture and start adopting a new one. Every time someone asks them about their past they just look a way and try not to answer because they don't one the rest of the people to know how they used to live and now that they have everything they wanted they act like they were never there.there's people that pretend to have lots of cars, money and houses just to look superior to others that just messed up i don't see the point of making others feel bad just to make you feel superior that's just stupid why do you pretend to be someone that you are not even close to?that's messed up I have seen this happen a lot of times in my life, and it makes me feel sad. That is all have to said I hope that one Day this society will change their point of view and accept all the mistakes they had done.
