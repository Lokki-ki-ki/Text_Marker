Dear Principal, The reason why I'm writing you this letter is because, I would like your students and all your school to help us to do a perform community service. All the schools are planning to do one in their community because the state weather It's not so good in the communities, because of the contamination of the fabrics and cars, it's better for the students and teachers to do a community service because that way we can have a better life without contamination and another way that helps is that we can have a better health. Those are my reasons to do a perform community and, I will like your school to participate with us on having a clean area to live in. Thank you
