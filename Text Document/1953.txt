Do you think that the first impression can change my statement?some people change the statement with the impressions for to made the best result or to have a bets answer, therefore not all people can make this possible, but while the people always try the bets.I'm disagree because, based on my experience some time I said my first impression, and It's hard to change, but is not impossible all is possible if you try the best, my mom said that you always have to change the first impression if it is not correct. My mom said that you always have to change the first impression, because you will be more secure of what you're doing, and your life will be better, and safe, I remember that she always toll me barefoot of what you choose, because that what you do in the present will affect your future.Sometimes you have to think of what you choose, and i choose that I am disagree, because I said if you think two time your impression will be better if you said the best impression, so you have to think what you said because if it is not correct you will have a big problem. Should the people said the first impression, but if you see that you first impression is not correct you have to change the first impression, and make a better impression, because two is better than one.
