Doing projects at school is really fun when it comes to working in groups. I think working in a group is more beneficial because of the extra help you'll have. You won't have to work a lot because your group will help and share the project so that everyone has a chance in it. Group projects will show you how to work with others and maybe even help you make new friends. Projects of any kind will look and be better when in groups, lots of ideas will be on the table for everyone to look and pick from. Working at school is hard. You get lightheaded and maybe even get tired. Group projects are so helpful because the project will be split up into parts where everyone in your group can take a part of it, all they have to do is post it together when finished. Having not to do all of it by your self is super nice. Another beneficial gift in working in groups is that you will be able to learn teamwork. Learning that is a good skill because you'll need teamwork for your lifetime. New people, classmates, workers, and much more will want to work with you because of how you and your team get along with one another. Projects of all kinds have to look good. Let's say your having a hard time trying to find the perfect color background for your poster. You can talk to your classmates who are in your group and ask them if they have any ideas of what color you should pick. Together you can find the perfect color, and together you can make your project look perfect and maybe be the one that has the best project in your who class. Group working is so much better for everyone because you'll learn teamwork, learn that you'll always have help when you need it, and your projects will always look good and perfect. The more people in your group, the more help, care, and ideas you'll have for your project. You'll learn something new from all of this and others will to. This is why I think working in groups is more beneficial for schools and jobs.
