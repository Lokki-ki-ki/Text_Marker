Adopted a four-day work week with each consisting of ten hours should my school follow up with this model. From my option yes. Reason I think it should is because we can have a 3-day weekend, spend more time with family, get enough sleep, if students have after school jobs they can have good hours. Like for example If my school have adopted a four-day school week with each day two hours. It would help a lot because I can go school do my two hours on Monday, Tuesday,Wednesday, and Thursday and I feel like we could help out teachers a lot not only students could help out staffs teachers and students. Has Friday Saturday Sunday off go work on my 3-day weekend get sleep spend time with my family get my sleep and naps. It would help a lot and be easier for others and me. So yes I feel like our school should follow up with for day school week extending the school day two hours others students would not like it that way but teachers and students to but from my opinion yes I think our school should follow up with that.
