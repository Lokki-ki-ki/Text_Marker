Would you rather ask one person or multiple for advice think that if you talk to more than one person for advice it will help you more. One time I saw this quot by LeBron James that said if you need advice always ask more than one because one person could be right and the other could be not be right so don't be scared to ask more than one person there is noting wrong about asking the person you look up to. It will most likely be better if you ask multiple people for good advice. If you are a person that does not like taking to other people you can just go to one person, or you can try something different and ask someone else but if you just want to ask one person you have to go to someone you trust, so they can give you some good feed back and good information. If I was to ask someone for advice I would go to a person that is very wise and makes smart choices, so they can help me make a smart choice so i don't make the bad choices. If you need good advice make sure you're going to the right person because you do not to be getting bad information if you have bad information you can make some bad choices. Getting advice from one person can also be good because what if you're telling them personal thing they can keep it a secret but if you tell multiple people your personal information can get out there and can start getting bulled, and you would not be able to trust anyone again so that is why sometimes you just have to tell one person if it is important information. And if you just don't trust anyone you can just go to your consular because your consular will never share your information with anyone, and she will understand you more because it could have happen to her as a child so one person can also be helpful.Don't forget asking for advice can always be useful if its one person or it multiply people it can still help you but if it is a person that does bad things, and you ask him for advice he can tell you to do the things he does, and you will turn out just like him so do not do to someone for advice if they don't make good choice. Advice can change people live if it is good.
