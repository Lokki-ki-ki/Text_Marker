The resources are very limited in our world. How to economize resources? It becomes a topic. Some businesses have four-day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours. This way may economize resources so school can use this pattern also. But for this idea people have different opinion. Someone says school should not follow this model by extending the school day two hours because only four-day school students can not learn enough knowledge. But in my opinion I think school should follow this model by extending the school day two hours because this pattern is very good for economize resources and four-day school may promote students efficient study. Some parents think four-day school is to sort for them children can not learn enough knowledge. And three-day weekend is too long. Then children may do not study. So parents worry about the foreground for them children. In my opinion I think school should follow this model by extending the school day two hours because this pattern is very good for economize resources. We can do an easy math for this question. How many electric for one lamp? How many lamp in one school? How many school in US? You can image it is a big resource spend just for electric. That is why I am agreed the four-day school. The four-day school have benefit to student also. Because students need to learn five-day knowledge in four-day. It may promote students efficient study. The efficient study is useful for the study and work at future. The resources are valuable for us. We mast economize them. So, I recommend should follow this model by extending the school day two hours.
