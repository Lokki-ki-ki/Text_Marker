My first opinion, would be that to be a good person, is you have to be your self no matter what is going to happen. For example a good behavior star at home because your parents have the responsibility to educate. Also, some people said the students are very bad for other students, like they are bad influence. My second, reason would be the own problems can affect, your career. For example your grades at school if you are a good person with other people to be a good citizen just be you because people the just talk never do something good. But sometime teen don't deserve what they have for example school, job, people the love them. After that well, if you work that is a good idea because you can focus, and two things but if you are weak that will be a terrible decision. So a good behavior is excellent, because you always can find friends, and maybe a girlfriend but den pent of you. In conclusion, if you are a good behavior you will be a good person, and the future, and a good guide for you children. Also, if you are a good student, you will have credit for college, but you have to be a good behavior. So the mean, that you responsibility is work very hard to complete your goals. And help other people, who need help because they would make you a good behavior.
