People these days don't go outdoors as much as they used to. I think that many people are avoiding going outside, because of cell phones. Going outdoors is actually more fun than staying indoors doing nothing, because you can do a lot of activities. Some activities you can do is play sports, practice sports, run laps, and do exercise. I think that some people find outdoor activities enjoyable, because they can do activities with others and enjoy the weather while doing activities. People should go outdoors more, because if they don't go outdoors and don't do activities, there is a chance that later on in life they can have weak bones. There are people who stay indoors just listening to music, but you can actually go outside and do activities while listening to music. If you don't like to play sports, exercise, or run laps you can just ride your bike. Riding your bike can actually help you later in life, because it can give you stronger bones and can improve your stamina and strength. Another thing that you can do is play outdoor games, such as tag, freeze tag, and hide and go seek tag, but there is many more. These outdoor games can also improve your stamina and strength. A good time to go outdoors is when its sunny and when you have nothing to do. Also, when your going outdoors make sure to bring someone with you so you can do activities with them. And if you have no one to do activities with head over to a local park to do activities with other people. Therefore, I suggest that people, especially kids, to go outdoors more.
