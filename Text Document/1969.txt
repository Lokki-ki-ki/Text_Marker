Duke Ellington was a jazz legend of his time. One quote he said," A problem is a chance for you to do your best." I will explain the meaning behind this. And if I agree with this or disagree. Let's begin on the meaning first. The meaning that he is saying is that form your problem you can make it better for your self. To see your problem you can teach your self to do better. That not to give up on your problem. That something bad can turn good. This quote is trying to modern you. I agree with this statement. Something bad will in fact turn something good. Not all bad thing will turn baas long as you can make them turn out good. You just have to see a chance to do so. Duke Ellington also may have had the same problem. Duke Ellington was a great jazz, but was also so a great person. That something bad that can turn to something that is good is very moderation. I agree with this very much. This is what it means and my opinion on the statement.
