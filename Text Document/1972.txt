Farmer British prime minister Winston Churchill once said that ''Success consists of going form failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. I agree with Churchill's Statement because some time in life u fail but never gave up in life. Keep fighting, and you will get to the place you want to get. Work hard if u fail and fail never say I'm done trying the same thing over and over. Because one day u will not know what will happen if u keep trying. Firstly, Some people think that success consists of going from failure to failure without loss some time people feel safe without loss in their life. For enplane you trying to become a prime minster in the future and people telling you. Can't become a prime minister but all you get to do is work heard in life true in yourself you can do anything you put you mind to in life. Secondly. Some people think that success consists of going from failure to failure with a loss. Some people think that failure to failure is good because some time people like to try one think over and over on tell they do good at it so that what some people think in life to gave when the chances to do the same thing over and over even if they couldn't do it they just when to keep trying. Sometime people think that success consists of going from failure to failure without loss. Because they don't like to keep trying one thing over and over, so they feel safe without loss in their life. But others think that success consists of going from failure to failure with a loss. Because people like to try the same thing over and over on tell they do good at it. Conclusion, sometime is good that "success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm." In everything you do in life. But sometime is good that ''success consists of going from failure to failure with a loss of enthusiasm.'' in life...
