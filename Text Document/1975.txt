First impressions are very important because that is the way people know you. It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change, and I agree with that statement, because it is hard to change people's mind and the way they think about you. When someone knows you or see you for the first time, the way you act, speak or the way you look is what they use to create an idea of how you really are. And when people already have an idea of how you are it is very hard to make them think different. Sometimes when you tell them you are a different person, they won't give you a chance to demonstrate if it is true, and they will just keep the idea they already have. People who knew you time ago and did not see you again they will keep the idea that they have about you, even if you already change. Sometimes you meet people in the wrong moment, and they get a bad impression about you. Then they just keep their distance or go away, and you can not do anything to change their opinion. First impressions are very hard to change because the majority of people judge you on the first thing they notice about you, it can be your appearance or the way you act. Although I think first impression are almost impossible to change there are people who think that it is not hard to change first impressions, and they may be not wrong also, because there are people who give you an opportunity to start over and show them that you are different; However even if there are some ways you can change the impression that someone has about you, there are more reasons why it is almost impossible to change first impressions. To conclude first impressions are almost impossible to change and people should be more carefully about first impressions. Because it is very hard to change the way a person thinks. And also it can affect your reputation.
