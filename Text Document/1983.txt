Imagine walking outside with your dog and someone comes up to and treats you like a criminal like he just killed a person, stole money, and bombed a house! Would you like to be treated like a criminal for the rest of your life with nobody talking to you or respecting you? 62% of the people around the world are not being treated with kindness or respect. People in many countries like Canada, France, and Russia are not being like a human being. People should start treating others how they want to be treated, that includes being nice, kind, and helpful to each other. In many countries people are not being treated right. 55% of the people have depression, loneliness, and sadness, because when they are not being treated with kindness they think no one likes or cares about them. Over 200 people around the world have committed suicide because they were not treated how they wanted to be treated. Not being kind or nice to others can cause damage to peoples feelings. People have been effected by others for not being treated correctly. Treating others with rudeness is not going to effect you or kill you, it is the opposite it will help you become a different and better person than you were before. Treating others with kindness can make peoples day wonderful. Some people might have a bad day and if you help them and treat them with kindness, they will feel a lot better. Being nice to people will make your life a lot easier, and you will feel like you have accomplished something big. I strongly believe that people should start being nice to others even if they are not respecting you. Being nice and respectful to others is what everyone wants you to be, but if you do the opposite than your life is going to become harder. People should start treating others how they want to be treated, and that includes being nice, helpful, and kind to everyone.
