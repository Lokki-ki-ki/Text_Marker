Some people say that failure plays in the pursuit of success. Other people say that failure do not play in the pursuit of success. Some people say that failure plays in the pursuit of success because if we fail we learn how to stand up after every time we fall down, For thing we never had we have to do something we never did, If we fail big we learn big things, and we fail once we have to try again. In life station we fail, but it does not mean we never pass, Life is hard to deal with it, but we can deal with it, every time we fail we have opportunity to fix it, Life is about gullible bad ideas come to our mind, but we don't have to think about it, we have to think positive, Every time we fail we think we are guilty, We think we are useless, We think we can not do it, but there is something in the back we have to catch it that thing is success. We are skillful that thing is nothing against our skills, we always worried about what others think what we accomplish and what we carry out, but it is our job that what we do, We have to lead our self to get success, and we are the finder, there is a lot of ways to pass we can get help from others:family, teachers,friends, and people;everybody is liable for their own work. Once I had biology class that I had to pass SOL I toke the SOL four times at the last time I pass it, It was hard to pass SOL for me but I never stop accomplish even I hate that, In some point in our life we fail, but we do not have to lose our firmness or solidity, We do not have to shrink responsibility, We have to strengthen our ideas, We have hopes in our life that we need to make them true, In some points in life we have to calm down take a keep breathe and focus eon our work, In a test when we fail we learn things like:what was in the test, how to use another strategy to pass the test, how to try, and what can we use in the test like dictionary;This is how failure play in the pursuit of success. Other people say that failure do not play in the pursuit of success because every time they try they fail.
