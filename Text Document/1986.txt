But It can get me in trouble like. When I'm doing a test I like to turn around and talk to my friends and I always get in trouble for this. Or when I'm in class I like to talk too much with my friends and not do my work, and sometimes I talk to the teacher for a long time and not do my work. Talking to other people can be a good thing you like not being shy. I used to be shy but I start talking to people and became not being as shy as I used. There are more ways that talking can be good for like building a good friendship with other people like least year. I started talking to other people this year and made a lot of new friends. And you can become best friends with the teacher is a good thing to have a good friendship with the teacher. Talking can help you with making new friends out of school.
