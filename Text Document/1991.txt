I agree with him because, we all have a specific dream or mission we want to accomplish and every dream or mission have a standard end point on less you expecting something far better than what you are having or where you are at that particular time or moment. Taking myself as an example or personal experienced person, I had always wanted to be a model when I was kid which I still want to be, but one thing have noticed is that you can't do anything on your own without sometimes you need help from people around you. Becoming a model was my idea and something I think it will be better for me and nothing beyond that standard; was calling people for help, applying from one agency to the other, but there was no help. Sometimes people even want to take advantage of that to use for their satisfaction(sexually) even though I know that is bad I still wanted to do it because of the goals I have set for myself. But then I got to realize I have to wait for the right time to come else people will take advantage of me. If I had never mastered it wouldn't have any experienced and would have never grown because I thought it was easy. Life haven't been easy after losing my dad some years ago, used to have a lot of plans in the nearest future with my dad. Was planning on graduating and buying a big house for us when I find myself a good job, but since I lost him everything just shattered and I don't know what to do. Am now living with my mom and stepdad so they the ones providing for me; I don't work, I can't buy personal stuff and that makes me feel bad, it makes me feel like am not doing anything in this world. Sitting idle will never let me grow until I do something better for myself. In my opinion we have to set a goal for ourselves at a certain point so that we won't rush or stuck in between things, and also not everybody or anybody has to master things before they take a step and things work out for them well, some even have experience from childhood.
