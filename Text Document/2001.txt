Imagine going to a school that has a longer student release time then any other school, imagine feeling tiered and restless everyday you come home from school, well the school board is about to make that "dream" happen for this school. The school days should not be extended because most of the students will not have a present time spending more hours in school, for example most students at the end of the school day feel tiered, and they just want to go home and sleep, if an extra hour gets added to the school day most of the students will be angry and agitated. A second reason why an extra hour shouldn't be added is because it will be confusing for parents, it will be confusing for parents because most parents have a specific time that they pick up their kids and when the time changes for the students release, parents will get confused, and it will be a disaster. A finial reason why an extra hour shouldn't be added is because after school courses will be longer, this will be an issue for after school buses because they will have to change their whole schedule for picking up students in the afternoon. In conclusion, students shouldn't have to have an extra hour added to their school days, and the school board should keep everything the same.
