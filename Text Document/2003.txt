No, I disagree with Emerson's statement. Some people think that just because they manipulate you will change. If some else want to make you different, or change you are because; They are not happy with teasels. I think that if the people that are around you want to change you are because they love how you are and want to be like you ; That best thing that you can do is get away from the people and make new ones that are passive and help you to become a better person, human. The worse thing that you can do is change because of others. People treated you bad because they want to accomplish their goal that is break you into pieces but, if you don't let those common, actions hurt you everything is going to okay. Last year there were some girls that deeply were hurting me my feels. In addition, Every day they would tell me dress good you have to be like this act like you are a model; They would also make fun of me too because I was dressing so poorly. I was wearing the same shoes every day same pants. When they saw me they would make the face like they were going to trow up. Therefore, I never let them make my self-esteem go down. I was so positive also my family give me good vibes too, They would tell me you know were you want to get at. You know your goals those are the want you have to pay attention to. Inconclution, don't let people make you something else. Some people think that you are going to change because they want but, they are wrong because you can be however makes you feel great with yourself. In the future I see that nobody is going to judge you.
