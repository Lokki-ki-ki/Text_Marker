I think it is a good idea for students to identify a career by the time they enter high school. However, some students are not good at every but if they do what they really love it can learn fun for students. It can also impact students to finish their goals and became better person in the future. Some students don have that kind of privilege as some students have to all subject, so they can graduate from high school to go to college. That what make some students dropping out of high school, because they think they are not smart enough or some students can't afford to pay for some school supply. I think it is a good idea for students to identify a career by the time they enter high school. First, it can make learning fun for students, and they can enjoy what every career they what in the future. Second, it can impact students to go to school learn instead for skipping school making them falling their classes. Third, students should be expected to take a career that make them happy and want to do, and they are also willing to do, also achieve their goals. Example for students to like the idea of identify, is to prepare them college and some may not go to college and start working. Inclusion students should choose a career the like and love. If they study the career they like their be less drop out of high school. They can also be success on what ever they can achieve in life. Also help them to a great future and everything is possible, however, I think that is a good idea for students to commit to a career a young age and to also help them became better person and make good chooses.
