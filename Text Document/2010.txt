I believe that changing the school lunch menu would be a good idea, there are reasons why the change of the lunch would be good idea; It can help students who are sick, It can help the students who play in a sport team, it can help this student who abuse eating at home. First reason: healthier school lunch menu can be good for many students who do fitness and also for those who play in the school sports teams, they need to be healthier, for example soccer players needs to be with good weight, so they can play good in their games, but if they are eating things with a lot of grease they would not be on the team, because they are not eating healthy. Second reason: The change of the school lunch menu can also be good for those students who abuse eating at home, for that I think the healthier lunch menu can be a good idea, because they abuse eating bad thing at home but, they eat healthier at school, that is the second reason why I choose that the healthy lunch menu is a good idea, because the students are eating better than what they eat at their homes. Third reason: This last reason is to show that the healthy food is better, because it helps students who are with any type of disease whether is a terminal disease or a normal disease, it doesn't matter what kind of disease can be, it just that eating healthy help them for example, there are many students who are with diabetes sometimes they to bring their lunch from their home, because at school there nothing they can eat, because everything may have grease or sugar on it, and that is the reason why student bring their lunch, because of their disease, so that is why I think healthy food can a good option for the school lunch menu. In conclusion, the healthier school lunch menu would be a good idea because it will help a lot of students in many ways including teachers, students, and all the people who work a school, I think is a good idea to be healthy not just out of school also inside the school, we just want to maintain our habits, and that can be good because, we are doing the right thing, and that is my opinion about the school lunch menu, we just want to improve with the school and doing this we will.
