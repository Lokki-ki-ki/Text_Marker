Imagine a place where honesty is the best policy. I disagree with the old proverb because honesty might hurt peoples feels around you, honesty can make people not like you any more, and honey can not be used in a matter that you're speaking of. First when you tell people how you really feel about them, it might hurt you in a way too, when people find out how you feel about them, it can be good or bad, when people tell true about someone it may hurt them, and how people tell you how they feel about you, it can be hurtful. Second when you tell someone how much you do not care about them can make you look bad, when you have a friend that you tell stuff that you do not like about him can be hurtful, when you talk about people in front of them can not help your friendship with them, when you said hurtful things about them, they will not like you anymore, and how you tell people about what you do not like about them, it can be harsh.Finally, when you tell people how you really feel differently can still be hurtful, the way you tell someone you do not like them can be more hurtful to them, when you speak of someone but in a different way can still grateful of hurtful, when you talk about someone in a nice vice, but it can still be mean, and how you talk about someone is up to you no matter what you say. There for you should not tell people how you feel about them no matter what you said or what they said about you.
