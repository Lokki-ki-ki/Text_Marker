I agree that success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm because you will be exited for your next step, and you want to know what's gonna happened once you have passed. For example if you fail on doing something, you will be exited on doing it again until you haven't pass because you might be thinking that's your dream to achieve it or it's really important to achieve what I fail in it. I heard story of a guy he fails a lot, but he didn't give up because he was still interested on the experiment, so he failed like 408 time I think, and he passed at 409th times, so you can imagine that he was still excited and interested on that experiment that he failed 408 times, and he got success at 409 times. So in life when people failed on something they move on because they might not be interested or exited on that thing that they have failed, but many other people will keep trying until they haven't achieved it. They will keep trying because they love it, or they are still excited on that work that they have failed. I know some people don't like doing one thing again and again but if you want to be success in life you have to keep doing it until you haven't achieved it because you can't be success in life without being a failure. When people failed on something they might say that its hard and I am not going to do it again because they didn't try their best on it, but if you keep trying you will get some hint on it, and it will be easier to achieve what you're working on. So if you failed on something be enthusiasm on it is will help you more to be success in life.
