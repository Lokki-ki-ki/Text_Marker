I think it's great for the older students to work with the younger student, because some young students haven't learned about what the older students learned, being a helper to younger ones especially in a school can be an amazing thing to do for exampleThey can help to teach them how to walk for the preschoolersThey can teach how to welcome people It also helps them to have a great future Older students can also (maybe) earn some money for being an excellent helper to the younger students. It can also be a great hobby for the older students to teach younger students how to live their normal lives and to greet others. Another reason why the older students to help the younger students is an excellent idea is how to be respectful and trustworthy to others. There can be a chance where the older students can teach younger students how to help others as well for examplePick up someone else stuff if it fell on the floored an old person cross the reattach kids how to write neatlyThis kind of program could help the environment so much. The students can also travel around the world to help younger students in other countries for exampleUnited KingdomNorwaySwedenDenmarkCanadaAnd more! Having this type of need and help could this world so much. It helps across the country, around the world, all types of students can help others younger students how to live their lives, it can help go to collage and get a job that their very great at and in their job they can learn as well, it can make them get a talent from their job, so they can learn how to do stuff in their jobs and become very good at. So yes I would recommend for the older students to help younger students (even around the world) how to live their normal lives. It can help so much for others, and it teaches respect and that's why in every school they should have older students helping younger students and in other countries they should also have older students help younger students how to live normal lives and have a great future, and they can also help their families and other families.
