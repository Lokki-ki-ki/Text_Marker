Based on my experiences, do I agree or disagree with Emerson's statement. I do agree on what Ralph Waldo statement said,"Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow." You should always push yourself to the max on everything you do. Try finding a better and faster way to solve what you already mastered. Work even harder than you worked before. Also try something harder than the previous thing you did. For example LeBron James, he wasn't rich or wealth when he was little, he had to work hard to get where he is now. LeBron trained every day to get better, stronger, and put his best on the basketball court, so he can stand out from the rest. Even today LeBron James is training to become the best NBA player ever and works really hard to beat/break other famous NBA players records. Each NBA superstars have different stories to tell on how they got there. Not only just NBA players work hard, other people around the world has stories to tell on how they never stopped working harder than before to grow. . These are the reasons and examples on why I do agree with Ralph Waldo statement.
