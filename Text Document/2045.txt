I strongly agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson. Because your never going to succeed as a person in the work force or something else. Because these people won't step out of their comfort zone. Because they are too lazy or scared. Ralph has a very good point : Lazy, shy, scared people won't succeed or grow as a person or in the work force. Doing more than what your good at helps grow your confidence, and your way of doing things for the better. Doing more could possibly give you a little higher pay raise or be a boss at a big company. Doing more than what your already good at can go a long way for you. You should start doing better right now because it will benefit you in so many ways. Not doing more than you can already do can possibly give you bad rep. Or some people will see you as a lazy person in life. Because that person is not pushing him or her self to do more or the beyond because that person isn't motivated to do anything more that their good at. That person won't succeed as much as the person that is doing more or the beyond. One time when I was a small Child. My Uncle always talked to me about a lot of stuff. The most important thing he told me is to do more than what I can already do. Because it will take me places, and it will make my life a lot better. He said if you do more. I will succeed more in life. When I got older he talked to me more about it. Because he knew I was going to do more in life. Now I work as hard and beyond than the other person. And make more money because I work more than I already mastered. I think working beyond than your comfort zone will help a lot. You can be really successful if you challenge yourself in life. It could be school or work. It doesn't hurt if you challenge your self. You will succeed as much as the other guy.
