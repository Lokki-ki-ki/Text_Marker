Of course the first impressions are almost impossible to change, when you meet with someone, you are waiting that this person can be nice to you, it depends on how you are as a person, sometimes people can make you think good or bad about them, that doesn't mean anything because you don't know how somebody really is as a person until you start knowing about them or start talking with them by any way, you can get information about them from friends or someone who already know this person in case you really want to know about them. It is okay to look over the person you will meet because that way you are feeling sure with yourself about what this person can do or say about you. Your personality is something that can define you as a human. If you want that people talk good about your personality when you meet them, you will have to give good impressions by doing things like saying hi when you arrive to some place, talk about the good things you have done, sports you play or any healthy activities you can achieve. If you are a socialist person you know people will look at your personality when you meet them because they want to know if you are a pleasing person, the minds can change, impressions never do, even if you know a person for a long period of time, you will never forget how they are before you meet them for the simple fact that the first time is something that almost nobody can forget. Another reason or example can be when you are looking for a job, you can give good impressions to your probably next boss and the people you will be working with, not just by how you acting it can be by how you are dressing too, your underwear many times can show much about you.
