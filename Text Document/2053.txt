Do people have to do all by they self? Sometimes is hard to do all the job without help. Or sometimes we only want someone who can we talk to. By working alone it makes feel alone. I believe that working with a group is better because we meet new cultures, we learn how to communicate, and we help each other. We meet new cultures by others' student who are in our group. We start to learn know his culture and what they believe. Furthermore, we start to learn about they language and how they communicate in their language too. Also, the food and the music from their country. Meet new persons from others country's is good so that way we start to know more about the world. We learn how to communicate with others person not only our language in others to. We start to talk with new person's. Furthermore, we start to share thing's from our culture and what like to do and our free times. Furthermore, we start work together and getting better by communicating. Communication is important for every one. In groups, we can help each other in projects or even in late work if we miss a day of class. Went there is a new person the group can help the new student with school stuff: where the next class is, where the cafeteria is, where the buses stop, etc. Also be in a group helps to perform our skills for communicate and language. Be in a group also help to make work easier because we help each other by putting ideas together. Groups are the best way to perform language speaking. Some people might say work alone is better because is only my self no one more, but in a group is more easy way to learn with help. Know new culture's from different's parts of the world is fun. Communicate is something important for live and our society to. We give support, we get support by working in group. Interact whit people help a lot and make work easier.
