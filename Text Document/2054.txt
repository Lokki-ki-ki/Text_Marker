I'm talking about if the school days should be extended by one and a half hours or not and the effects it'll have towards the students, teachers, and the whole school together. So adding an hour and a half to a school can open a lot of opportunities to learn, more electives, and what most students would think of a longer day at school is border, but school is where you socialize the most during the day and as a kid school is where you meet most of your long time friends, so there is more than just being bored at school it's a place you can socialize, have fun, and learn all in one day. If it were up to me whether to leave the school schedule as it is or to add an hour and half to the school day I would have to disagree because if the teachers were to give piles of homework then when you get home you'd be exhausted and drained to the point where you aren't able to then even if you did manage to then you would be so tired that it would affect the next day which would cause you to barely do any work in school, so the students need to get out of school, so they can get their homework done. If students were to stay at school till 4pm assuming there bedtime is around 9pm then the would basically only have 5 hours to do their homework but wait so then imagine if they had chores to do around the house then once they've done their chores they'd be even more exhausted so after all that they had done what if they wanted to relax a little now they have such little time to do anything during their time off from school that they might have to stay up longer than they usually do now it's about 6am in the morning after last night they could barely get a goods night rest and their body and mind are completely drained for today and all they have is good breakfast to get their mind to at least keep them knowledgeable for the day and this whole cycle repeats over and over, but then you can at least get a good weekend of relaxing so that you'll be refreshed for the weekdays. I disagree with the decision to extend the school day because of the effects that it has towards students and how it can effect their mind and how much productivity they are able to produce could be affected due to overwhelming amount of work put upon a child. There are definitely many pros to having a good education and to be able to live a good life. Students may not want to go to school and can find it very overwhelming but at the same time the students are working very hard, so they can have the best possible life they can. School is a place where you go to learn, have fun, and the school has provided the time so that students can learn what they want by having electives that they like the best because that what they might want to be when they grow up because if the school didn't have such excellent teachers the students could never succeed on their own and that's why the teachers have to relate to the student, so they can have a much better understanding so that they can proceed to adulthood where their decisions can affect them badly.
