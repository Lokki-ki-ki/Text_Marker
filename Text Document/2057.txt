I think that they should not do a homework club because what if students don't got time for that. An other reason would be is that many students don't do their homework nowadays, so it was just be a waste time for the teachers unless they are getting paid extra for staying after school now that's a different story. An other reason is what if none of the students stayed after school the school would have to be sure if students would a Ten this homework club. Students should be able to do their homework on their own to be honest so that way they learn more cause maybe the teacher might be giving the students the answers and that's just not right! My other reason why they shouldn't do the homework club is what if most teachers don't give out homework like I don't get a lot of homework but maybe someone else wouldn't get homework. Would any teachers palpitate in the homework club, do they know that teachers would agree on doing this club? How long would this homework club be an hour or 30 minutes at what would it end because students have stuff to do out of school. Do planets know about this club would they let their children stay after school is a way for them to get home if anyone can't pick the student up?? Would this homework club interfir with any other after school clubs or what if students already do a club, and they need help with homework, but they can't go to the homework club because they have to go to the club they do. Does the whole school want to do this or just some students cause not this club would be worthless. In conclusion I think that they should not do the homework club.
