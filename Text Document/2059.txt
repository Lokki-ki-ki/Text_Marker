It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change. Some people think that is impossible to change, because they had been said or think that you cannot change your first impression, when you at first meet or start knowing someone, that is not true because clearly you can change your first impression, even though it can be the same or different as the first impression you had at the beginning of everything, but you may also be insecure or confuse of your own thoughts and feelings. I am in disagreement with this prompt that it has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change, because just imagine clearly your first impression it may not be the same when at first you start knowing someone, when at first you meet someone, or even when at first you look someone by the first time, people may also say that is impossible to assume your first impression at someone, because your perspective of someone may be different from another perspectives of others, you may have the same perspective or also different from other people. The day when at first came to the United States it was really hard for me and for my family from Mexico, I was really nervous and also a little scared, it was one of my dreams that became real, I was so impressed and surprised of everything, the first impression that I used to have of the United States changed, now that I am living in the United States, the impression is different because now I know how is to live in a different country. Not is always going to be how you thought it would be, but it can be even better, even thought your impression was different or was the same at the beginning. The day I came to this school Generic_School, my impression from when I meet my counselor Generic_Name were different from my impression after I meet her, I thought she was going to be really mad and mean counselor, or I even thought she was going to be a counselor that doesn't like Hispanic people, but all my thoughts were wrong, my impression was really wrong because my thoughts about her were wrong, now that I know how is my counselor, my first impression and perspective changed from the one that I used to have and believe. In conclusion, as the end of this prompt that it has been first impressions are almost impossible to change is wrong, that is not believable because your first impressions and your own thoughts can be wrong, even though you thought it was going to be something at the end is not how you thought it was going to be, first impressions are possible to change because they can be wrong even though your perspective can be true, or it can be also wrong. Don't let first impressions to trick you because they may be wrong, you can change them if you want, but make sure to be secure.
