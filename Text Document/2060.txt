I don't think the principal should make the students clean up litter or do community service because they might have other thinks to do with their family's. Elementary students can probably do it because they might not have anything to do because they still in elementary, and they probably have time to pick up litter or maybe jr high students can help too if their not to busy maybe some of the students that don't play any sports can probably help too. In some schools the principals are probably going to require all the students to do community services because how they probably act or maybe she or he going to make they bad people do community service. People like me can probably do it on weekends just to help others because I'm always busy during the week. The principals should make the people who act bad during the week and during the weekend that will probably help them change a lot they going to get tired of picking up litter and doing community service.
