Have you wondered why local companies and organizations plus the different schools don't add up well this will answer why? This prompt will try to figure out the answer of this question. These local companies and organizations that allow students from different schools should interact certain professions. Teachers and students can think of organization that allow other schools to join in that profession. I think I should do is help the students that needed help with the organization they wanted. If the employer wants me to visit I will say this if I get accepted for this job first thank you second is you probably want to go to my office. I chose this job is because I like to help other people with what they really need not want but need. Students should create new professions in the future so then the future students can access the professions that the students from the past did the same with teachers. The local companies can grow even bigger if they needed to. Some local companies and organizations hate students because they touch very expensive, valuable, dangerous items plus they don't even pay any attention to you. Others can be totally calm about it. They actually answer some of your questions, listen to you for once not faking it. This workplace that I'm working at (if I'm enrolled) well I had to find a backup job, but it will take a while so I have to find specific job for it.
