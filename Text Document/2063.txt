Ralph Waldo Emerson believe that "to be yourself in a world that constantly trying to make you something else you not are the greater accomplishment." personally I disagree only cause nowadays most young adults, child, and teens prefer to be around the same individuals who act, talk and basically does everything the same exact way. It's a little creepy in all honesty but it's the world we live in where people just want to fit in and act normal to seek comfort and approval from someone else even when they don't need. Another reason I do not agree is because this generation prefers technology to human contact so It's easy to see why they don't go their own path, but instead they prefer to just follow the crowd and not follow what they want its mind-blowing how we have to take a sol too just to see if you smart when all you can do is just sit in a class and listen to a student and see how smart they are without a dummy boy test but I'm just a young student who's following the crowd just to get a diploma even tho at this point a diploma will barely take you far, but it looks good on resume so that's why I am doing this exact test to follow the crowd of dead students just trying to graduate for a family that don't even care if I'm dead or alive as long as I got a diploma
