Teacher want to make a homework club for student at schools. I think they want to start this club, so students do there homework for often and teacher are going to helps you if your need help. This is going help kids be responsible and learn more. Doing a homework club after school is going to help kids a lot.2. I think it's a good idea but also a bad idea. The reason why I think its good is because it can help kids if they need help. The reason I think is a bad idea is because kids are going to have to stay after school but its bad because they might have something planed. Its good and bad because kids need to learn how to be responsible.3. Tenns/kids might think it's a waist of time. They might get bored and just might not to there homework. They won't like staying after school kids and teens might just think it's a waist of time. Furthermore, they just Mont like it at all.4. I support this because It's going to help students out by doing there homework. Students are going to do there homework now. Even tho they might think its dumb it's not its really going to help them. Hopefully student start doing there homework now.
