Dear Teacher, I think that working in group or working alone has some advantages and disadvantages. But in my opinion I would say that one that is more beneficial is working in a group. Working in a group is less work and more ideas. As I was saying that there are advantages and disadvantages, My first advantage of working alone is that you get to work alone with no distraction from others. Second advantage is that you can focus and ask the teacher for help. Last reason is that you can put as many ideas you want and a lot of effort and ask the teacher to check your work to see how you're doing working. The disadvantage of working alone is that you will not get the work done faster. My second reason is that working alone is not fun because you working independent and doing all the work. My first advantage is that working in group you get to hear different ideas from each other. My second advantage is that you can talk together and gets lots of ideas and fix mistakes together. Last advantage is that working in a group you can finish the work faster. The first disadvantage is that working in a group there is going to be too much talking and also not focusing. Second disadvantage is that when you are working together sometimes one person does the whole work and the other doesn't. Last disadvantage is that you can easily get destructive and not get the work done. To conclude this I think working in a group is more beneficial. I choose working in group because there are many advantages. Therefore, working in a group is less work and turning in work fast, As a result you won't have to worry about asking for help or not having ideas because that's is why you are in a group to get your work done and have a lot of information.
