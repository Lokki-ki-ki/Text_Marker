I think is good take elective courses for the student, because if he wants to graduate to the school, but if you want more graduated in four years is better, because you're learning more knowledge is important that you learn. If you take a decision studied, studied because in your future is helping the stewed is good, but the people don't like studying in my opinion is better take elective course, because I learning more information.example.1. In my country all people speak Spanish, when I go to the Salvador and I speak two language, I feel proud, my English is bad, but all time practice and is important learning each day.2. If you don't take elective course you not learn anything, because you are lazy you need studied is better your family are proud if you want a good title.3. In your future, if you have a good title you have a good work. All people in this country don't have work and don't win money is because don't go to the school, when him was a child, but we are a good opportunity in the school, all student need studying for a good future.4. If the Pepe don't to entrust, you meet to prove that always to beat you and make feel the mother.5. If you take elective courses in summer I think is bad, because in the summer is not the same they all year, all years you have more information is better, but in summer ID two months or three is bad.
