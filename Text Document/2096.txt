Hey my name is Generic_Name, and today I'm here at Generic_School talking with some students about life treating situations where you have to take actions. Let's say there was a lockdown in your school and the bad guy was at your classroom, and he was banging on the door, and broke the glass window to unlock the classroom door now he found his way in! Now the best thing to do is grab anything like books, desks,chairs anything you can throw at him. Now let's talk about fire drills the best thing to do is not panic, you just got to act fast and think smart your main priority is for you and your friends to get out the building safely. Follow your teacher during the fire, cover your mouth with your shirt or sweater don't inhale the smoke that's how you pass out from the smoke. Now the last thing I'm going to go over with these 5 graders is what to do when an earth quake is happening, the first thing you want to do is get underneath or sink something stable tuck and duck your head. don't go under something that can fall on you that could be very risky and dangerous.
