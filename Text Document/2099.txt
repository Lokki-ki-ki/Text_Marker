I think that students should take an art, music, and drama class. Cause by taking these classes they can learn more about what happens in each classes. Also, if they do one of those classes they can receive credits on their GPA. First reason, student can learn what happens in that class like art. Art is a great elective class because they can have more credits, and they can learn more interesting things in that class. Also, art can do things for the student because while time pass, and they are great in drawing it could take him or her to collage it could make better degree collage. For example, if you also can be in an art contest in your school or anywhere else. Secondly, students can do these classes. However, music is also a great elective class because it could help you like in school and anywhere else because they know how you sing. But, music is not only singing students can also play interment like guitar, flat and many more. So, student can also impress them with interment. Also, it helps with credits by it could take them to a different better collage. Lastly, these classes are better to take as an elective class because they can perform in events in school like drama. Drama is a great elective class because students get to move around and have fun and dance. Also, they can do it on their free time and as their elective class. For example, students can impress their family with their meaning talent. Also, with their talent they can go to different countries and perform their and other places too and preform too. In cousin, this is why students should take art, music, drama as their elective class. That ways they can get credits for doing these classes.improve with their talents and go around the world.
