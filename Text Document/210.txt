I like to be a pilot in the future. But I can't see with my eye's that much good, and the pilot job don't except that if I want to be a pilot my eye's have to be good. So I Agree with Emerson's statement. I hope in the future that I can fix my eye's that I can be a pilot. Some people disagree with that, that I can be a pilot and my eye's not good or it doesn't matter. If I don't fix my eye's I will think with another job that I like to be on it. I like to be a dentist but this job so hard to be a dentist, and it takes like 5-8 years to be a dentist, but I will do my best to get a job that I like it and the job get for me more money. If I'm going to be a pilot it takes just 2-5 year to be a pilot, and it's not that hard. I like this job so much so I'm going to do my best to be pilot in the future. I have three brothers Generic_Name, Generic_Name, and Generic_Name. Generic_Name like to be a Doctor, Generic_Name like to get something in the Computer's, Generic_Name like to be engineered, and lastly I love to be a pilot.
