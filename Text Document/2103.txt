I disagree with this article because is not always how you will see first impression is how you will see the person in general. Is not a great idea to change how you are to impress other people. Like for example I'm shy meeting new people but sometimes I don't know what happen to me that I talk to people like I meet them before. Not all what you see is who it is sometime the appearance lies. People sometime lie to get something or someone. Other people do it to get attention because they fell alone, and they change to get attention. Other people do it to get attention because they fell alone, and they change to get attention. I sometime do it to but only because I fell left out of the group so sometime I act different. I don't like it but is the only way that I can get people attention. Some people will like if they are them self because you don't what to date someone and that person is not the person that you see in the picture. Other people like to deceive other people only for the money, to play around with them or be bad with you. Like for example I'm shy meeting new people but sometimes I don't know what happen to me that I talk to people like I meet them before. Sometime when I act crazy is because I like someone or because I need sleep, but most of the time is when I'm in love. I am very weird to be around. I like to jock a lot but that doesn't change me who am I. Is not a great idea to change how you are to impress other people. There are sometime that you have to impress other people like when you are trying to get a job. You have to look impressing, so they can higher you for the job. Sometime it will need more than changing who you are. But most of the time you don't have to impress the people with the look you can impress with how good you are with the job.
