I think classes such as art, music,and drama class should be electives. Why should we be required to take art, music,and drama class if we are not interested? Schools should allow students to pick their classes. If we were allowed to pick our electives then students would enjoy school more. We should be able to like our electives not dislike them. What if student had to take art but they don't like it? They would not try the work and just fail the class. What about drama class, not everyone enjoys it so it shouldn't be required. Not every student wants to sing or play an instrument. Therefore, they shouldn't be forced to take a music class. Although it would be great for some student not all would like those classes. Therefore, student should be allowed to pick their classes. If they were electives we would pick classes that interest us and would actually try to do work. Students would pass their classes more. Therefore, those class should be electives.
