I agree with the idea of after school homework club, because by actually coming to an after school homework club it can help you get better at the class you need help. We know some students don't like doing their homework and that's why they don't get good grades. All we want to do is help them get better at school, so they can be something in life, school it's important for learning and an after school homework club can help then. It doesn't matter if you get your answer wrong you learn from your mistakes by practicing you get better at it. And by coming after school to finish your homework is great because you have time to do other activities after you finish your homework. Doing your homework is going to help you be someone in the future. Homework helps you raise your grades up. An after school club is going to help you a lot we all want kids to be good at school. I know some students think the homework is a waste of time but no it's going to help you anytime in life. We should have an after school homework club it's better for our school and students all we want is their best in school. But it's their choice to come after school to finish their homework I know we want the best for them, but it's their choice we can't make them come. A lot of students are failing school because they don't do their homework you just have to try it homework helps a lot like in math, science,social studies and reading class being good at every class is going to help you in college. We need after school homework clubs in our school, every school should have after school clubs it's for the best for every school we all need them after school homework clubs.
