Dear. PrincipalI'll say the policy #1 because student it's a good rule that student can only use there cell phone during the lunch and other free time so that the student can do something that make them fun during lunchtime. it's also good because student uses there phone to call there parent to pick them up, or they forgot something on their house he or she can just call there parent to bring it to school.Bring cell phone in school is important because cell phone is not just for texting its also for emergency for your parent if you need something, or you have to go somewhere after school. You can also call and tell them that don't pick me up because I'm going to my friend house and I call you when you have to pick me up.By: one of the student
