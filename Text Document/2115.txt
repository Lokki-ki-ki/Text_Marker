I feel that this learning program can help younger and older students and have a very big an effect on the people involved in the program, that is taking place in the schools. Not many other schools have this program to get extra help and kids need to understand that the there is a big opportunity that is being given to them, and they need to take it. This program helps the younger students get an opportunity to get better at something that they are having a hard time on inside of school. If the kids are having a hard time on doing work at home or not understanding, they don't have to get worried about there grades dropping because there are other options that you can do. If the younger kids parents do not have that much time to sit and help them with work, then they can just get help from the learning program that happens at there school. The more you go to the meetings the better you will get even if it takes time. I also feel that this could be important to the older kids that help as well. This program would do very good for their service hours for there service hours for school. It must be a good feeling for them because they were chosen to do something they are good and smart at. They could possibly put this program on there college resume if they would like to become a teacher when they grow up. There are many other reasons that this program could be helpful to others.
