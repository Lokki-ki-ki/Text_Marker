Many student's take districts offer programs because, They think that is easier. School's maybe is easy, if student's going to school only three years. Also, some parents maybe are agreed with that. If student's go three years to school. The students parents spend a little money in their. Also, student's can work early and get their own money. Especially, if school during three years. But, definitely, many student's take the longer way in high school. That's the mean. The four years.Also, student's choose this districts offer programs to graduated quickly from high school and work. For example, my friend take districts offer programs, and he is graduated right now. But, he spends all his time only studying and him have his diploma and him is working. But, I'm taking the four years in school, not only ... but also, obviously, I'm learning more. Because, I spend more time in school. Clearly students wants to graduate from high school, that's why they take these programs. And some students choose this programs because, they want to go to the collage. And want to meet their dream. I understand that many student's wants to graduate quickly and get their diplomas. But take the four years in high school is better than districts offer program. Because, student's who take these programs are grieved and, obviously, there are very busy and expressed. Because they don't have time. They only pass all days, evening and summer studying, but student's who take the four years are fresh of the mind, and they have time for studying and work at the same time. And can spend time for their friend and family, that's why four years in high school is better than three years. Definitely, some students prefer districts offer programs. But they kill their own self. Because they pass studying ans studying. Their many students like studying a lot, but its importantly, that they save their health.
