And people can say that you are a great person because of your attitude how you treat other's people having a good attitude can make people think you are a different person than people say, how you treat others people that's why being good can help you count on different types of people including your friends and your family. When you are having bad things and problems. Happen in your life you feel sad depressing and trying to quit of everything .but you don't have to give up you have to still Fighting, so you can Solve all this and leave this at the Past .and start like nothing Happen and keep having that positive attitude on you. Having a good a attitude in school can make teachers see that you are a quiet and chill guy who just trading to do great on classes and trying to pass the school and graduated and be a better person than others who just having a bad attitude in school and quit.that's why having a good attitude can make you be a good person with others and people see that. You can make all your wishes true if you being honest and prepared, so you can be in the work you want for you in the future and make a better life to your self and your family. And being good with your attitude can make easy things happen to you and people treat you good
