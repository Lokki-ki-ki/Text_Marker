My name is Generic_Name and I conclude my subject of topic to one of my most enjoyable educational activities to be the of subject P.E. I closed this subject because me myself am an athlete in many sports such as basketball, football,swimming, and across which is why I feel as if I have a great connection with the subject of P. E since the platform of the class is physical education which most of the time includes sports. This connection is established from the joy of physical and fitness related activities that health/P. E can assure. I find this activities mostly enjoyable since it has some of the sports I play in after hours outside of school grounds, which builds a strong connection. I also enjoy the connection I make with others such as the other students and the teacher since health/P. E are mostly social based activities, were teamwork and cooperation are needed. This is an art in which others, and you could interact with each other which is to the right extent can bring joy to those who socialize in educational manners, but with that also brings educational activities which is much more of important when it comes to P. E because education always comes first when it comes to any class in the education atmosphere. P. E may bring a positive impact on others who need social activities to interact with others, which is what makes P. E enjoyable and impactful for me and much others. I feel as if this interaction and connection in physical education/P. E is a great enjoyable way inside of school grounds that can provide a break from classes which you sit all day and study and is why I choose this as my topic of interest when it comes to my opinionated most enjoyable activity.
