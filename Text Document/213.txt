Some people know their own personality if they want to be a good character or bad. Some people can give bad advice or some people want to trap you. For example at my school there is a lot of people that they have bad personality or vice. People need to understand or think before what character they want because everyone is different their thought or feelings. Some people need to choose what character is right for themselves.
