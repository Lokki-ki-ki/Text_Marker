Do you believe to know a person through one impression? Some people believe that most of the people's personality will depends on their presentation or the way that dress up, they think that your knowledge or your personality is base on how you look. I believe that the first Impression could change for the following three reasons; Your clothes or how you look do not show your type of personality, the kind of person who you are will depend on knowing the person and through knowing the person your idea about the person could change. The majority of people classify the type of person base on how they look, What I believe is that your clothes and how your look do not say or show your type of personality or the kind of person who you really are. Base on my short experience to know a person takes time and the first impression could be unfavorable in strong relationships or friendships that's why I believe that who you are will depend on knowing what kind of person you are. Most of the strong friendships or relationships that I know they were enemies, or they did have a good impression about the person at first time but through the time they had the privilege to know the person, and they found a good kind of person. To conclude the first impression is a good way to present ourselves but through knowing the person we will find that the first impression does not care when knew the kind of person that's why I believe that first impression could change through knowing that person.
