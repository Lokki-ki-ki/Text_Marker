Do you think that the school hours should extend? School is already not fun for many of the students, and by staying more in school students may have a bad mood or admitted, and it may lead to bad behavior and not make them get good grades! I disagree because it can be very tiring to stay school longer, it can change your mood of being in school, and you may want to get out with friends or family. The First reason, Is because if we stay longer in school you are going to get more tired. If you get tired in school you are not going to have more energy to go outside and entertain yourself. And you would just go home and sleep all day long. However, if we don't extend the school hours, we won't be as tired, and we would have energy to go outside. The Second reason, Is that if we stay longer in school it can change the way you are. Staying in school longer can change your mood because you won't be as happy. Because you would have to stay in school longer. Also, you might have teachers you don't really like, and you would have to see them longer. However, it doesn't have to be that way, if we don't extend the school hours. The Final reason, Is that you wouldn't have time to spend with your friends or family. Because most of that time you would be in school. And spending time with friends/family is the most important thing in life and school shouldn't take all the space from your life. In conclusion, I disagree that the school should add more school hours. Because it is a waste of time, and it gets you more tired, it changes yourself, and it doesn't give more time to spend with friends/family.
