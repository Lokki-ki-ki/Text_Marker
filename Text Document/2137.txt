Planning to change, healthier school lunch would eliminate students favorite cafeteria food. Students won't get full and will still have an empty space in their stomach. The healthy food won't make students concrete in class because they're going to be hungry, might make an impact in students body's. Changing school lunch to a new, healthcare lunch could case some problems students way to learn and eat. Having students eat in a healthcare way, could case a problem in their body, highs school and middle school students will be the ones who are going to be effect by this change. Tha's the time when they have to eat enough food, so they can develop their body's because that's when puberty comes on, and students need to prepare, for this type of sickness that they might be going thought, they need to be prepared, eating in a healthy way sometime cause weakness in some students bodies. By eating in a healthy way students will have healthy life, will be able to play any sports that they want, they're going to be ready for school, will have their mind open, they will be succeed in class and school, life, this could make students to be out of any pain or sickness the planning of changing food cafeteria could be a problem in students way to eat, students would make a radical change in their body, I think the administration or county need to make a survey whether do this change, they need to understand that some school have differences religion, races, they need to consider that as one of the cons because they can't make students neat food that they're not allow to eat, if that's the case students won't eat and that might a problem because those students might get sick, if they're planning to do a change, it has to be the one with offering food from around the world so can everyone be able to eat.
