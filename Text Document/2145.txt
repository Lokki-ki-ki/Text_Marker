My name is Generic_Name. I am going to take a position about self-reliance, whether about if you should people make their own decisions, or should they seek guidance from experts and authorities about lives important matters. I honestly think that seek guidance from experts is better, because you can ask them about how they did to accomplish their goals, and also they have more experience about life. First, guidance from experts it can be much better, because experts can give more options, more ideas. Also, you can ask them about what you need in life to be success. Besides ask them about their life, how they did to accomplish their goals. Because if we are in any situation that we know we could not do it alone, we should ask them about any idea that they will give to us. Second, those people they know almost everything about life, they could tell you what's steps you need to follow to achieve. As we know, billionaires people worked hard to be success, even if they failed something, even if life make them week, they never give up. They keep trying and trying until they make their dreams comes truth. that's why seek guidance is important for someone that want a better life. Finally, in life we need help, even if we say that we don't need we need it. Because we can not do everything by our self. That's why we should ask for help with people that can teach us about life. People that will give us tips to be success in life, because they have more experience and also because they know almost about everything. Sincerely, Generic_Name.
