I think that setting a curfew time for teenagers during the week and weekends is good because it's letting them know the time they can leave there house, and the time they so there parents wouldn't worry about them leaving in the middle of night just to go out with friends. If their weekday curfew is until 10pm then it's acceptable because it's a school night so they at least just go home after school, change, and go out with friends until 10pm. If they get home after 10pm then they are disobeying, and breaking the law which would get them in so much trouble so like the consequences would be gone to court, talk with the judge, and know what there punishment would be either going to be on prohibition for 2 weeks, having an ankle bracelet so if they try to sneak out it would alert an officer then they would immediately would be put in juvenile detention center for a week, and if those consequences don't work then they would be officially be put with an officer to take him to school, home, and work, so they don't try to sneak out again. The weekend curfew would be all day until 12am. This curfew time is only set Fridays and Saturdays. If they come back home after 12am then there are going to be actual real more serious consequences of being on house arrest, be on prohibition with an officer watching you, taking you to where you're supposed to be if any of those don't work then they will just be locked up in a Juvenile detention center for 4 weeks, so they would actually have no freedom only time is when they get visitation time with their parents visit, and when they are released from that place. In conclusion I believe that having a weekday and weekend curfew is good because it warns kids what there consequences will be if they disobey the law and going out after curfew hours.
