(1)A talent I have is pranking people. Something that inspired me to do pranks on people was YouTube creator. He went out in public and did these prank that inspired me to try them. My first prank I did was on my family by putting a wop pie cushion on they seat it was fun, and it made me laugh. I started to do more pranks on them, but the pranks started to get boring they were no more good ideas. My new ideas were using the pranks in new ways. Not what they were designed to do in new creative ways like putting a cockroach under a cookie that idea went really well it scared a lot of people that was one of my creative pranks.my second one was. It was called Valentines through the hand box. This one took a little more effort than the rest of them because you had to cut a big hole through the box that was the size of your hand. How this work was on Valentines I would have gave someone a big box that is the shape of a heart and cover the bottom of the box were the hand would go in, and they would open it and a hand would pop out at them. This is how I started to develop to use pranks to make people laugh. I still use these pranks I buy them off Amazon and at 5 Below. Now I .use the prank more on teachers for the most part and how I use it is in public I place a fake poop on the ground and people got disgusted, and I once had a robot cockroach made people freak out. Well I think it is important to have some pranks in our life it makes us feel joy and happy afterword because how the world is nowadays, they are not that much joy in life more people than ever are sad, so we all need sometimes a laugh in our lives no better way to do it by a harmless prank. Pranking people is my talent those are some reason why I am good at pranking people and that how I use pranking in my life.
