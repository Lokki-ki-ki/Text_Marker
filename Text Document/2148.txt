I disagree with the statement about a positive attitude is the key to success in life because there's others things you need to be success in life anyone can have a positive attitude, and they are not success or probably won't be, there's only few percent of people in this world that are success there are some people that don't have a positive attitude, and they are success in life. For example people with a positive attitude they try so hard to be success in life, but they can't they keep trying, trying and nothing happens. Now some people with a bad attitude are success they don't even have to try to work hard to be success. Image how many people work hard and hard every day just be success in life, but there's a couple of people that have a positive attitude, and they are success in life basically living life great, there are people that don't have a positive attitude they just do bad things to be success. Now doing bad things is not right because you can be success for a while. For example, it can be stealing or drugs if you are doing those things you will be success but is not a right choice for you, and you keep doing it one day you will have to pay for what you did, most people prefer to work hard every day to be able to have at least everything, I prefer people to do the right thing because doing bad is not going to get you anywhere you might be success but it won't be forever I'd rather work hard so I can be success in life
