Dear Manager, My school would like to have a partnership with your local companies. This organization will allow many students to explore the profession of being makeup artist. They can learn how to do hair, makeup, and how to dress. Hair is very difficult to manage. Some people don't even have healthy hair most of the time. Humans die there hair too much, They put so many products in there hair it damages. To many people straightens or curl there hair with heat every day, and that damages your hair really badly and fast. If students go to this course, students can learn how to take care of hair and keep it healthy. Many people want to learn how to do makeup, but today's makeup is too expensive. If students take this cores it would give them the chose to learn and not wonder how it would feel like if they didn't take that cures because it was too expensive or because they didn't have the tools like makeup. I want this partnership to show people they can become who they want to be when they grow up. You wear clothing every day, people don't know how to dress. This course will help you how to match, color skim and many more. This class will help you in your every day life. This partnership will really with the students personal social health. The students will learn more, it can help them in there every day life. They don't have to weary about if they can't afford tho go to collage, and they can't accomplish their dreams.
