In the United States, the limitation to human contact due to technology has had a positive effect on people's lives. In modern times, technology has been very helpful to everyone. Technology performs multitasks without physical contacts with others. Due to this, people don't have to go to stores to get groceries and other materials. This is especially convenient for older ones because they are weak and stressing themselves could cause heart diseases and even death. But now they sit home and order anything, saving their health. Secondly, technology has gone to the highest level. Today one could stay at home and socialize with friends and family without physical contact. Technology has provided social media apps making it easier to communicate without making human contact. Besides communication, people feel safer talking about their rights, the government and politics in general on social media than in public. In cases of emergency, social media has been proved to be the fastest way of saving lives, accidents, and most importantly many deaths. Obviously, technology has made it possible for kids who don't like school, and are poor learners at school due to the nature of the environment to learn online at home giving them another opportunity to become something great. Even though they don't make physical contact with friends, they are provided a better learning environment, less stressful activities, and the motivation to learn more and become a contribution to the society's well-being which everyone today wants. Again this brings us to the good part about social media, though kids may not have physical contacts with friends, they have the social media. Big Thanks to technology, there might not be human contact, but it is going to the positive change peoples lives. The world will be a better place.
