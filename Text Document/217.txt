I say it's a good idea that the school menu should change to being healthier because a lot of students eat junk food mostly every day, need to eat more fruits and vegetables, and wanting a healthy live. As you know, students eat junk food food anywhere they go to such as movie theaters, gas stations, and restaurants. Some places do serve healthy foods and snacks, but people rather choose junk food because they're not use to eating good. Most stores put the unhealthy foods in the front, so kids can go straight into putting it in their carts or baskets. However, we can't manage telling people if they want to eat healthy or not. Every school want kids to get a fruit or a vegetable at lunch. Some kids chose not to get a fruit or vegetable because they don't care about eating it or they just throws away. Eating veggies will help you with your body like for an example; a carrot will help with your eyes. If kids don't want to get any of their fruits or veggies they could give it to a friend that will love to eat it instead of wasting it. Eating healthy will not cause you to have many problems but, eating unhealthy will cause many problems. I think parents should focus on what their kids are eating for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. If you don't like eating unhealthy you could always pack lunch. Although, you could eat junk food once or twice a week and not every day. I personality agree to having the school changing the school menu because the world has change, and we want to eat more fruit and veggies, having our lives healthy, and wanting kids to stop eating junk food all the time. It has been an issue for the past years and I think it's time for schools to have different types of food. Not everyone wants to eat healthy food we could sometime have some unhealthy at lunch. These are the reasons I want the school menu to change.
