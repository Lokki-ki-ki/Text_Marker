I support that schools should follow the same model as the business model who have adopted a four-day work week to conserve energy and resources, energy, and extending the school day two hours, this kind of model could make them feel better to attempt to class, and start taking action about conserving energy and think about our future there could be a day when our energy and resource comes to an end for humanity if we don't take actions.However, they should consider that energy and resources benefits us and the world, we mostly need energy in everything to survive and resources it's a natural source of wealth or revenue that enhances the quality of human life, if businesses have adopted a four-day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours to conserve energy and resource for their future, my school should follow this model because I think schools are the most who spend and waste energy and resource by their thousands of students that attempt there. With a four-day school week, student would at least get rid of depression which adds unnecessary stress, they will have a one break day to do their homework and assignments without staying up all night just to finish it, at the same time it will benefit the environment by just having a four-day school week, it will be harder for them to adapt for a longer day of school and a shorter week of school, some of them will not adapt to it but still it would help them to be more time at home with their family instead of be at school stressing. Whatever, If parents and students got the benefit of having a day off, parent will have the time that they didn't have before with their kids they will more hours of work and school but still it may help them to have a better connection, and at least they would have a day off stressing and worrying about their work and assignments. In Conclusion, cutting one day out of school would be helpful for young teenagers who are studying and working at the same time to help their families, and it would conserve much energy and resource than before, making our environment greater by conserving energy and resource in only four days of work for adults and four days of school for teenagers who attempt to any school.
