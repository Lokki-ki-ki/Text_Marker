I agree with this prompt or sentence because it is the truth. A problem is not just a problem it a way for a second chance and a success in life. A problem does not mean you a life is over or I can not go back to redo it again, yes you can it your life you choose how to solve your problems. An example, having an F in your test does not mean it the end no it not it the beginning because that how you start by giving your self a failure path and make it a success and that how a problem start. A way to solve a problem is like in school, at home, in the street, is talking it out with someone who can help in school you can talk to you teacher your consular, at home you can talk to you mom, sister, dad, brother, in the street if it is a fight talk to each other, because a street is not a place to fight. When having a problem you will know because it will give you this negative feelings like you are not perfect you can do anything right, you should know that failure is a lead to problem, a problem is a lead to second chance, second chance is a way to be success, just so you know giving yourself a second chance and accepting second chance when someone offers it that like the best thing in life cause keeping the positive spirit is what and giving yourself a chance is what others want so use it like you use your phone.
