Although former British minister Winston Churchill says "success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm." actually to get to success sometimes does take failure to get it. Actually this is very true for people who never give and work hard even after they fail time and time and again. For example when you fail at something to keep trying after till you succeed. Some people think if you fail you won't be successful that is not true. If you never give up you will be successful. Another example when you fall you always get back up and keep going and pushing forward. Only you can decide if you want to always fail or try harder. To get success it ain't easy. There is a saying nothing that is easy to get is wroth having. This relates to what Churchill said. Winston Churchill is a wise man and I would agree with him. Everything he said about failing and being successful after is true. They are so many successful people who have failed plenty of times in their life. It happens to all people no can be perfect at what they want or do in their life. Inconclousion Winston Churchill is a wise man for his saying. His saying can motivate many people who feel like giving up after failing.
