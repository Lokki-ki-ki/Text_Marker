Having online classes could be so much helpful and easier for those kids who don't leave near the school, or doesn't own car, it could be helpful because student wouldn't have to wait outside for a bus to pick them up, or for someone to take them to school, it could be easier because they could finish their classes from their house they would just need any electronic device and a connection to Wi-Fi. By having online classes I think it could make students life much easier, because if they get sick they can still take their classes, and they wouldn't have to worry about making other students sick and there would be fewer chances of getting sick by other student, student would not have any excuse for not taking their classes, taking online classes could also help this student who are always late to school because they would take their class from their house, so any bad weather could not be an obstacle. There are many good things about taking classes online but there always something's students would need to give in order to have this benefits and that thing is social life, many students would never see their friends again because everyone has a different mind no everybody has the same goals and not everyone likes the same stuff so in my opinion that's one negative thing of online classes, but there are always a solution the teacher could make a project that could involve working in groups and I think online classes could change students life.
