Tomas Jefferson wrote "Determine never to be idle...it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing." In this prompt I think that Tomas Jefferson was trying to said is that people have too determinate to never be idle to always do something, because after that you will see how much things you may be done, and there always 2 types of people. The people who would be agree or not agree with this phrase. That is why some people may think that is not always necessary to do something or work hard for things that we want, because they think that we can work for our things when is their necessary time. Also, some people may think that you need to do something when things are really necessary or when you want something. I hardly believe that the phrase that Tomas Jefferson wrote is totally true. We need always been working in our life to get wonderful thing, as he said is wonderful how much we can do whit things if we are always doing something for it. It is also that we that he wrote that sentences, because I can totally feel how he specific said" Determinate never to be idea" I take that sentence like never let yourself be that. In the world are so many people negative that always think that we cannot get that things that we want that is always the reason why people become lazy with their dream, because they always think with negatively. There are many people outside looking for an excuse to be idle. In conclusion, I hardly believe that I'm totally agree with Tomas Jefferson because we can keep working or doing something because after that, we would see the things that we have done or our results that our hard work. Just we need to keep doing something or working for something great in our future as a person successful that we want to be.
