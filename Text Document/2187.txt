I agree with this statement because I think that unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow in your life. Some people try very hard to mastered thing in there life. For examples people will try there best do mastered something in there life and with their friend and family. First some people try very to mastered something there life they are not good that. And people try to be a good friend to there best friend. Poeple try very hard, to keep there job and to not get fire for there job because they need the money to pay bill at home and food to there famliy.at lest people, if you try to do something beyond you will not grow in life. Poeple go beyond thing at they are not good at and the try very hard be at end they fail and get sad about it. Some friends are good at mastered video game, and they play Va day. Some friends get mad wind they lost, and then they get into a fight just beaus they lost to a video game.
