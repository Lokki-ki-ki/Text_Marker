Something that I would like to accomplish is raising and taking care of my baby bearded dragon, until it is fully grown and ready to start breeding. I have to feed my bearded dragon its required insects covered in reptile calcium, and bearded dragons need proper lighting. Bearded dragons need these requirements so they can grow up to be healthy and strong, the calcium covered insects makes the bearded dragons bones strong, the UVB lights also help the bearded dragons bones. The climate of a bearded dragons natural habitat is very hot since they can be found everywhere in Australian deserts. I want my bearded dragon to grow up being friendly, and not so aggressive, so since bearded dragons are social animals they often need to be in contact with a person and keep being played with or can be taken out of its tank and let it roam around the room. Bearded dragons need to get bigger tanks as they grow old because they get bigger and more curious. This is really important to me because I always loved reptiles as a kid and I want to prove to my parents that I am capable of taking care of a bearded dragon.
