Technology allows people to complete many tasks without having contact with others. People can check out books, shop, and play games without speaking to another person. I think it's a positive effect on people's lives. It can make there lives way easier. Someone may not like going anywhere to check out books and shop, so they prefer to order them online. Technology helps a lot of people in their lives, an example can be someone that doesn't want to attend public school, so they prefer taking online classes. Online classes are helpful for students because they may have jobs to go to, and they don't have time to attend, so they can take online courses. Not just students but also teachers, instead of grading papers they can grade them online if they want to. Technology helps a lot of students with school and teachers with grading and other stuff. Technology can help people lives in other ways, someone that doesn't like to go shopping can order them through online without speaking to anybody. Maybe they don't have time to go to the store and don't have transportation to get there. Technology can not just help you to order stuff, but it can help you find an item that you don't know where it is without speaking to another person. There are many stores that you can check out by yourselves instead of waiting in line for another person that can ring you up. Technology helps a lot of people's lives in shopping. So yes, I think technology has a positive effect on people's lives. It helps them in a lot of ways. Not just ordering stuff online but also physically. Someone that is it a wheelchair can get a chair with buttons on it for it can move on its own instead of pushing themselves. Technology allows people to complete many tasks without having contact with others.
