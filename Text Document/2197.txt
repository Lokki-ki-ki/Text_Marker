I think is a good, idea that students get different types of classes because that might help to choose their career. It's a perfect idea knowing what you're going to do with your life once you're done with high school. There are so many teens that once they are out high school they don't know what jobs they want to start and study for it. I think that that's why they should have many more classes that that's what It's going to help them continue with their thinking of what career to choose once they graduate high school. For example classes that are for automotive technology is a comfortable job in a way that you learn more about cars but in a way is dangerous at the same time because cars have so many heavy parts that could injure you. Another comfortable job is being a lower lawyers don't do much other than being in the computer or doing paperwork in that cause you don't have to be outside in the cold working on a bad job that involves working in a construction site. And that's the main idea that schools should offer career choices that involves students in a career class that will teach them once they are out school and that the jobs will interest the students. There are so many students that drop out school because is not interesting to them but that's a bad idea of not going to school because if a student doesn't graduate they will be working for some restaurant not earning that much money and working so many hours that's why it is important for teens to stay in school so that the school could offer them on what job they will choose once they graduate high school. School is one of the most important places where they will teach students what decisions they should take on their life once they are adults. In some cases students start going to college once they are out school because they got an idea of how their class works and what for what job they are going to study.
