Some may say it's impossible because of the impression you left on a person, but people can always change. People can leave multiple impressions other people, it's just the person to decide if there willing to see the whole picture. No one is perfect, people make mistakes all the time is a part of being human. From my experience I've left multiple impressions on people, "ya people maybe naive nor stubborn to pay attention to things they want see". Especially at a job interview your probably won't ready, alarm didn't work, and 5 minutes late, the manager is thought that you a lazy person that doesn't deserve it, but you meet all the requirements for the job. Then can see what your really made of. You may meet people on a bad day, and they seem angry that doesn't define a person. People can change, so others can as well. People can be blunt off the first impression and every time they you that's the first thing that comes to mind, but you always change the way they think of you. It might take minutes, hours,days, months, or maybe years, but people will always try again and again to get the satisfaction needed. When people are motivated they can do anything. So I don't think its impossible but say it is possible to change the first impression.
