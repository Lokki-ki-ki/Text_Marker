In the world, nobody is more than another, human is equality, you will never grow if you do one thing many times and that make you just stand in one place, you will grow if you try something more heighten than what you already know, and you will be successful in your life. Like math, if you have trouble you can find a teacher or somebody knows ask for help, and then you can try it again if you want for sure you can do it, then you find a new question harder to do to improve yourself. The prompt asking me do I agree or disagree try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow. Agree : you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered. Disagree : you don't do anything beyond what you have already mastered. Conclusion : I agree with the statement. You try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will grow. However, if you don't do anything beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow. Nothing is impossible, you need to trust yourself and do something more than you know, you can do it with someone else, you can grow more and more. The way of success will come to you.
