Students should enjoy summer break, because they would not have to worry about school, and they can get to relax some educators should not complain about summer break being too long cause having a long break is better than to go to school cause school you have to do work and do tests. But in during the summer break you get to relax all day summer is the time to hang out with your friends and family and to go on vacation to enjoy life too and not think about school or work that is what summer is all about and for educators saying that students are not going to remember what they learned in school. From last year when they come back to school is not true because some people remember what they learned last year and some don't and I don't think summer break should be 3 to 4 weeks cause most of time students are in school more than they get to have a long break. I think summer break should be for 2 months, so people can have a break from school because I know how school can be stressful for students because they have to worry about a lot of things passing their classes passing their sols that gets stressful to students. Cause that is the most important things in school I think for winter break has to be 2 weeks cause of Christmas and new years that time is to enjoy those 2 holidays with your family and then come back to school in January. For spring break should always be in March not in April because it has always been spring break in March spring break should be 2 weeks to take a break from school and to come back in school with a fresh mind to get ready to go to school and learn. So the students can be prepared the only break in fall is Thanksgiving which is only a week that seems fair cause is just the 2nd holiday in November having breaks is always a good thing I don't know why some people hate it is gets you time to think about things it helps people a lot to relive stress on people it makes people happy and puts a smile on people's faces and that is all I have to say about all the breaks for the seasons.
