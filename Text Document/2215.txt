I agree with this statement because people can learn from mistakes lets say that I got a bad grade on my quiz and my teacher let me retake the quiz and I do well, so I learn what to do better on my quiz by studying and doing my work, and no one is perfect, so we do a lot of mistakes, but we can learn from them, try not to make the same mistake that people do around the world have made because you made a mistake does not mean that you have failed, but you can still keep going and that, at the same time I kinda disagree with it at the same time because some time you don't even now what to do at the same time they will reject people if people fail there quiz so some time they will reject people from what they did, so I am kinda at the middle part because sometimes you can win and lose at the same time. That there are better thinking people can do you best lets say that I lost against this guy on a game really can't be mad at the same time because you to show respect not get mad at the same time so at the same time you got now more about the other person people.
