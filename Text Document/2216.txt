Because if you are just idle you're not get anything done in your whole life and just sitting idle it's not going to help you see what you acutely need for your life, or your family life, or if you don't have a family think about your future. They are people who don't have the life as you do. They wish and dream to have a better life to do what they want to do the things they wish to, but you already have a live and everything you need in your life so dream big and make it come true.

Like some students say that they just want to be a famous, if you want to a famous or important you better do something in your life, the other famous people did something they weren't idle in fact they spend their time just to tell us to do something in our life. Like if you want to be a doctor you have to study for your dreams to be what ever you wanted to be. Being an idle it's not going tho help you life depend on you and your ideas. If you have dreamlike needs energy to do something imagine you have a good idea about doing a project in engineering, and you designed really impressive, and the teacher like it, and you entered the engineering science. Years later you found a good job in your career and you have money, that make everyone proud about what you just did in your life and your family are thankful to you. Life needs you and your ideas to prove yourself don't sit and do nothing and was your time playing around. Because if you are just idle and doing nothing that doesn't make any since you have to do what ever you want to do it's your life no noes life your own life fight for it and go crazy for if and never give up says I con't do this, and it's possible yes you can.
