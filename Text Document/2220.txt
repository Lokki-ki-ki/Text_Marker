Dr. Manager, I would like to work in "Envy Nail' your nail salon, l been there before and is the salon where l always want to work l feel very comfortable when I'm there and l think when someone needs to work is important to do what the person always wanted to do or what the person like because in that way the worker is going to do a perfect job. Also, I'm very sociable and friendly and l think is something that is very important because the customers need to feel comfortable, in that way the costumer are going to like the job of the worker and likely is going back later again to get done the nails in your salon.l have one year getting my nails done in your salon and l like the techniques that the workers use and the time and care that they put for make the nails, l think your salon is perfect for the people that get nails and want to have different colors on their nails, because your salon have a lot choices of colors in gel and acrylic powder. L would be happy to lorn all the techniques and styles that your workers do on the customers like, french nail, sculpture nail, or gel nail. I have two years that l practice the basic steps for making a nail for example, how put the acrylic powder properly in the fake or real nail and how put the gel on the sculpture nail. At this moment I'm morning how to make figures with acrylic powder POR example, roses, flowers or any other figures that costumer want and also l been practice how to do pedicure and how do a properly a massage. My idea is lorn more of what l know and work on what l always wanted to be, l would be happy if you allow me to visit you nail salon and give to me employment, i'm going to work very hard and put effort on the nails that I'm going to make.
