No, I don't think the school board should add an extra hour to school each day. My reasoning is because If you put this in a students' perspective, they have to wake up 5 or 6 am to get ready for school, stay there for 9 hours and come home to do homework. You can't even imagine coming home an hour and a half later trying to get homework done. If the less time students are home, the less time they have to complete homework or assignments. I also want to point out If students are trying to get more homework done, the less sleep they're getting and If kids come to school the next day, they won't get the information they need for their classes because they're tired. Students will start to fail in school because of no sleep and this time in won't be there fault for their sleep management. This time it will be the school boards fault for adding stress to these children and why they're not getting enough sleep. I'm not saying it's impossible for student to come home an hour and a half late and still get their sleep, but If they have homework, and they spend there day focused on if it's likely students won't get good sleep. Reasons like these are why some students can't graduate from high school. To rap this up I say that the main reason why I don't think it is a smart idea for the school board to add an extra hour and a half to school because, more students time management of doing homework and getting sleep would likely fail in succeeding in school for present and future. I hope the school boards read this and take time to considerate this idea that would just give another reason for students to fail in the future.
