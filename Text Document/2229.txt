Dear diary today in the English class my friends were saying that in sum point in life the first impressions are almost impossible to change, and I asked other people and well what I think is that they should not say that because the person can be in a bad moment of there life and they aren't doing good, it also can be that they don't treat everybody the same way and one person told me that they could act differently I thought that it's a good reason of that person and I said thank you for your answer. My first reason is that the person can be in a bad moment of there life and they aren't doing good because they just moved to another place far were they lived before and left there friends or family, someone in the family died, they feel lonely, for example I have been in this situation a lot of times and my situation is that I move a lot because of the places were my parents need to work and in some point they told me that we were going to move each year and I changed how I felt, I felt upset and not wanting to go to school any more I only wanted to have fun; this year I haven't moved, but my parents are seeing what house to get 1 hour from here we may move in January and I don't feel good thinking about that because here in Generic_School I feel like in home they treat me good, the teachers help you if you need something or if you have a problem in or out of school they also tray to help you in any way, and another reason is that I made a lot of friends and I really don't want to leave them (the people here are great). In some reasons the people don't treat everybody the same way because all persons sometimes are treated differently by the person; it haps pend to me one time and I really didn't like it; it was one time that I went to a party, and I was going to meat up with a group of friends when I got there they didn't want to talk to me, I wondered why, but I got to know by a girl that sow me wanting to talk to them, and it was because they told them something that I didn't even know that I did; I went to talk with the girls and explain that I did int do nothing and told them that I had a twin sister and that I didn't tel them that I had a twin and that she was the opposite to me, so things got fixed, and we went to party all night and to have fun. The reason that the kid gave me was that they could act differently because some kids are special in some part of there life; they can be aggressive or nice because they can't control there feelings sometimes or most of the time kids with a disease one of the example that he gave me is that he knew a kid and that he will help and be nice, but sometimes he will be very mad and say things to the persons that he knew; he can't control his character, but they were teachers that will explain what he had, and they would be better and not say things about hem. Well now that we sow all this I think that I am correct people don't always be perfect, everybody makes errors in life or someone causes them. Thank you for hearing me today!! Have a great day!!
