The British naturalist and politician John Lubbock wrote," your character will be what you yourself choose to make it." I disagree with that because our character formed by influences beyond our control, for example we all leaned what's right or wrong, let's take a baby for example the leaned for people all around them, by seeing what they do for example how they speak, how they walk and how they dress. The only they can not be influences by other people if their parent stop then from doing all those things. Take me for example as a baby grow up speaking French because that's that the Language. When I move to my grandma place she speaks Spanish with me, so now I speak Spanish, and French I could never speak those languages if I was not influence by those around me. I get the part that said we choose our own character trait because we all now if something worn or not we can choose to the wrong thing or the right thing it up to us at this point for example some ask you what to be in the future now if you choose to make even tho you have a choosey there is a 50/50 present you will follow the same path as some in your life that influences you. We all are influences by something or someone an example some teen want to be raper because there is someone around their that one, or they want to be a basketball player because the know a basketball player they think he or she is cool. If you disagree with me, ask yourself, how did I become who I'm today? Did I influence by someone? Or did I choose to become who I'm? I disaster with that "character will be what you yourself choose to make it."
