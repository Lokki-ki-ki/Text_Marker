I say no because you cannot Jude someone by there first impressions has a person. It would be nice getting to know the person and if their mature its fine from first impressions. Getting to know who the person is by skin them about them self not just be like of there not good enough. For an example if someone is tired and your gonna be like oh their lazy you can't just base them from there first impressions. Is it impossible to change no not impossible because it i your mentality. In life nothing is impossible you can easily change to a whole different lets say, you a very mean person you can always change and be super nice to everyone. You can always change for who you are and for me, I was very quiet I would never want to go talk to people because I was really shy with people but now I like to talking to everyone else and i don't care who the person is I always introduce my self. So I strongly agree with this statement you cannot Jude someone by their first impressions some people thought I was really mean when they first met me because I would be tired end of the day and i wouldn't walk people because I was lazy and i didn't have that every to talk. That's why I changed my mentality, so people would not call me lazy because its annoying so that's why I changed my whole life around i didn't want to be so the same so I just changed, that made me super happy just for having a new lifestyle. When someone says it is impossible to change their wrong because they don't believe in them selves that they can change has a new person i didn't think I was going to be a whole new different person. And now I do really like who I am always smiling. Back then I would not like to smile I was a really boring person. I won't lie I have based people have their first impressions and be like dam there not cool people and end of the day they are cool people. So it is not good judging someone to fast so in my option I say yes i strongly agree. From Generic_Name
