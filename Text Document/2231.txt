A problem can be good or bad. You can learn from the problem that you made. Sometimes you can't learn from the problem you did. I can agree and disagree with this statement. Not all people can think it can be true because you can do something wrong and get in trouble for it. You can keep doing the same problem and not care for it. You can choose what your problems are. Furthermore, you don't need to have a problem to do your best. Furthermore, you can be good at something and not have a problem with it. Some problems are good because you learn from what's good and bad. If you do something that's wrong it's ok. Because doing the right thing can be hard for people to do. Much of the time theirs something you can't do about it. People choose to take the wrong path for their life and some don't. The ones who take the wrong path will go through a lot of trouble. They would have a lot of problems that they can't change but just cause you that path doesn't mean you change it. Even the ones who are living good doesn't mean their not going through some problems because everyone does. So what I think it's trying to tell us is would you work out your problems to become the best. You can change one problem that is stopping you from doing something. That you can change the wrong thing to a good thing. Even if you most up doesn't mean you are bad. Learn from the problem you did and grow up as you learn from it. Want to be the best you will have to learn what's the best from your mistake's.
