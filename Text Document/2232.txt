Technology has given us humans positive and negative effects in life. For example Bullying is serious and negative effect on us, Bullying isn't just physical contact there is cyberbullying and that's were the technology come in. Another negative effect that technology has given us is No Contact, The new generation does not have contact as like people would have had before. We need contact because it shows that we can work with people, and it also shows that we are social. One positive thing about technology is new research for example nowadays we can just go on Google and search up things we might need help with, For example if you are confused over a topic, or you want to know a little more about it, you can just go on Google and search it up. Another positive effect technology has given us is Locations, Locations is a part of every day's life for example if you need to go somewhere you can just go on your phone and search up the name of the place where you want to go. Technology is something we need nowadays because there are creations all over the world being created every day. Human contact is what we expect but nowadays we can't find that because it either goes on Snapchat, Instagram, or add a friend on Facebook even adults do this not just kids and teens. Human contact is something that we need everywhere in life we need these things at work, school,sports teams and more. So human contact can be limited now days, but there isn't any change became more and more technology keeps coming towards our way, and we can't stop it. In conclusion this is what I think about technology I've given positive and negative feed back about technology on human contact.
