Working with group is more beneficial because, if a person work in group then he/she can share thought and ideas before start working. Also, it helps student to learn how to communicate with other team member because team work is very important and necessary to learn before students start working professionally. I believe that working in group will gives student more ideas and everyone in groups can share their thoughts with each other. It also helps students to finish their work on time and the most important is that not only one person have burden to do all work. Communication is the key of working in group because, group working is also helping students to learn how to communicate and how people should behave when they work as a team. Team work and communication is very important to learn before a person go to college or before start working professionally because, if a person does not have ability to work in team then it would be very hard to adjust in college or professional work environment. There are many advantages of working in group for instance, student can plan and share ideas with their group, they can discuss the work with each other before the start work on any project, and they can also help each other if any of the group member is confused in anything. The most important part of any project or any other work is finish on time and if not then no matter how much hard work the person put is just useless. Group working is also safe time because everyone work together rather than only one person has burden to complete all work. To conclude, I just want to mention that I understand that working alone is more beneficial for some people but, working in group is much better easier than working alone. For instance, working in group gives more ideas from different people's sense of humor and people get chance to work with different people whose thoughts and working style is different.
