Success comes in so many different ways, but the real question is how can have a good attitude lead you to being more successful in life. I think that starts with your attitude, attitude plays a big part in your life, for example if your about to take a huge test in math class, and you tell yourself before the east that you're going to fail and you're just having a negative attitude about it, your more likely to fail, but if you walk into math class with a good attitude and your content in yourself and you're just going to give it your beast I think your more likely to pass the east. When you think of successes you think of famous people you might think of a person on TV or someone that has slots of money. If you think about it the people you each on TV or any of the people you think are successful had to have struggled in life to get to the place they are now. What ever the struggle was they had to get back up and push themselves. There are successful people everywhere for example it could be your mom, or your dad, brother, sister anyone you know. Successes doesn't have to be a big thing it could be you doing something like running a mile or being the first person in your family to go to college or just getting all As in school Whatever it is having a good attitude in life can really change your life. I try to be as successful as I can if that's in school I try my beast, Whatever it is I know I can't accomplish anything without a good attitude. For example in the future I want to be a fashion visitor, but that amount happen for years but there things I can do to push myself to the thing I want to do. Things I can do now to get to my outer, I can start with a positive attitude There are hatters everywhere that try to bring you down you just have to learn how to ignore them and learn how to great a path for yourself.
