Conserving energy and resources should not mean that children should go to school for only four day and 2 hours. Children are not going to be able to process what there learning. Some children can't benefit from this. There are today people that need more help than others. People need the benefit of more school day. School is in portent to many people. We need them school day. Conserving energy is a good thing for people, but children need time for school, with not that much time for school we are going to have a lot of people failing or dropping out. Children like school because outside of school, they don't have nothing and school is the way out of having nothing, but they make the best of it. Then people that don't have nothing make something out this safes from school like sports. People that play sports need school too. How are they going to play if their grads are bad, or they need to stay after school to tracts. They need it more because there trying to reach to the NFL and not that much people can do it. People are just trying to make it throw or other people that just don't care. Two hours, you are not going to Laura nothing, time is most important to many people. People will need more than 2 hours. Teachers most important need more time to work. There's not even going to get paid will they need more time. How are they going to pay their bills. People need to understand that people have imprint thing to pay. People need to thank about other people not just them selves. Time people need it, but we need more, we don't need less. People are happy how they are right now. The time is most in portent to people. Conserving energy and resources are very in portent but just to go to school just four day and two hours i don't bereave It's that in portent.
