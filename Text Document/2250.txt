When people ask for advice, sometimes seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice by seeing if most peoples opinions are the same and it's a good advice some opinions maybe better than others, you can also receive better advice from different people like your best friend can give you advice that will help you lot but the other person that you don't really talk to that person doesn't really know how to help you like your best friend does, each opinion can help you with something different like someone may give you advice about a sport you may not need it right now, but you could use it later in life, so each opinion can help you later in life it may not help you never know, for example if you need advice on how to do better in school or how to get your grades up you would ask a teacher or your friends but someone else can give you bad advice or it doesn't help your on how not to do well in school so it's better to ask multiple people then just one because you have a higher chance of getting good advice from different people, and you have more to opinions then just asking one person became he may not have th the best advice, but he will try to help, but you have a lower hand you can see with help more and with don't really don't help you would be getting good advice that will satisfied you, so in my opinion asking multiple people for advice is better is a better chose then just asking one person.
