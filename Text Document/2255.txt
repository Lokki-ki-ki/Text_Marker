Small acts of kindness can come for yourself and others. For example when you see someone that is siting alone at lunch you should invite them to sit white you. Like this one time my fried and I were siting at a tad at lunch, then we sow a boy siting alone at a tad. So we desisted to ask him if he wanted to sit withe us, and he side "alright I would love to." after that we found out we have simpler classes as him. We all became good friends and weer still friends to this day, so an act of kindness can make a friendship. Moving to a new school can be herded. Because you're living your friends that you had for a way you can make the new kid feel confab in school, by showing then where their classes are explaining something they don't understand and asking hem to sit with you at lunch and you and can help each other with homework you don't get. And show their around town and make them feel like there wanted in school, and you can show he or she the clubs after school and if you to have similarity showing someone you care makes them feel like their going to be okay at their new school and will proudly make them feel more confident. A nether way of showing an act of kindness is by listing to peoples and friends. Pronouns beaus sometimes you fell down and have no one to talk to, so you can be that someone, listen, give advice and concert you have to let then know you their for them.
