I don't think curfews keep teenagers out of trouble, because some teenagers can get in trouble before the curfew time, so I curfew or not some teenagers will get in trouble, for example one day my sister was out with her people, and my dad told her that her curfew is 2:00 p. m, but she did not come home at that time, so my dad ask her why did you miss your curfew, she told my dad that what is the point of curfew and my dad told her to get you out of trouble, she was like curfew or not if I will get in trouble I will and my mom told my dad she has a point, so my dad was I like you right so when every you go out make sure you come home. Now that you know that all teenagers do not need curfews we should think about the other teenagers who do not get in trouble, and see what we can do to change thing.
