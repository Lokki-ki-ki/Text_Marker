I believe, what Thomas Jefferson wrote about" determine never to be elder "because we would never know how can we impact on someone life or in our life. Never say never, don't stop doing what you love, just because some people won't appreciate your work. Two example why no to stop doing you, you could make people happy, people could also learn how to become better on someone's life, and even you never give up, just do you, and you will see the result at the end.First, I'ts amazing how much may be done if you're always doing something. Every minute, hours, seconds, and days is important, because we can do a lot in like 10 min. Stop thinking too much don't wasted. I always like to keep my self busy. Specially if is about soccer. Take care of your self, your body needs energy, fun things to do, so that way you and your brain don't feel irritating. Personally, like 10 years ago my cousin die because he's girlfriend didn't want to with him, for the fact that he only think he could do was using drugs and nothing appropriated., we found him on a tree. In addition, this is why don't stop doing something. Who knows probably a girl/ guy could fall in love with you, or you could also make people feel strong for whatever situation you could be you will see the result at the end. Keep doing what the people with illness do, never give up, they always have a smile on their face. Even people famous they kill their self because they feel alone, because they don't interact with the community, or with fun people that could make their life happy and easier. In conclusion, I agree on what Thomas Jefferson wrote. Personally I don't waste time, I keep doing me, I am always doing something for example, school, work and I also play soccer for the Generic_City recreation soccer. My advice for you is that if you don't something similar of what happen with my cousin, take care of your self, keep yourself busy as much as you can.
