Some people say decisions should be make by our self, however others says you should make decisions fallowed by people who are more experts have more experiences and time to deal with hard decisions. I support the idea that we should all make our own decisions because it's our life we should know what's better for us for our future, however some people like to make decisions based on others' people decisions they think they would do the same as others when they make the same choices that experts and experiences people make. In one case I had to make a hard decision probably a life chancing decision I had to choose between staying at my country or come to U.S.A. and have a better life or at least more opportunities at first I din'd know what to do I wasn't sure what would be the best or what would is the consequences of a bad decisions I want it to ask people who have all ready make that decision what should I do what they think should be best for me but I didn't because that was my own choice a choice that no one else can make but me. But there are some cases where decisions are not make by the person who the decision would affect like when you're a baby, or under the age parents are the ones who would make decisions for you, they would do what they think is bets for you, and sometimes you may not agree with what they decided for you but in those cases is where people with more experiences and knowledge meant to know what's best for you.However, I think we should all be free of making our own decisions ether you want to make it by your self, or you want others with more time and experiences to help or make your decisions, but people should be awarded of what they choose because every decision can give a consequence and the only one who can make the right choice is you.
