I would be interested in joining a program that you guys have to offer. I am very interested in automobiles and would want to look for any companies where I could work on vehicles as my career opportunity. Furthermore, I've always loved the idea that I could one day learn about cars; how a vehicle gets off of the assembly line to the road. There are many companies that are in demand for mechanics to turn wrenches and do not care that they are going to get their hands dirty on the job and for me, I would be happy just doing that for a long time. Ever since I was a kid I've worked on my dads' and uncles' car. By changing their tires and putting the tires back and doing oil changes to tuning and modifying my uncles' car from a stock making two-hundred horsepower to eight-hundred horsepower. Ever since I've had experience with vehicles in my lifetime and working in a company to get my degree and one day open my shop and be able to work on cars would be a dream come true. When I got older I started reading books about cars from the first ever made vehicle to where you had to crank to start the car to when technology was slowly progressing and that was not a thing anymore. Throughout the years technologies have increased dramatically and vehicles are being driven by themselves and I would love to work on self derivable vehicles because I know that I would be able to make it right and make sure that the customer is always the priority, and I am always a hundred percent and determined to make the vehicle a high functioning machine with so many capabilities. I would love to one day work for Tesla or BMW in making electric to hybrid vehicles and knowing that it would be a fun career option while doing something that I always loved ever since I was a little boy I would be grateful.
