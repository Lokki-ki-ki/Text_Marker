I think that older and younger students being together is a perfect idea cause that means that the older student can help the younger student and If an older student needs help with something one of the younger students can possibly help. I think that all schools should have programs like this because then the younger student can learn from the older one. Also, the older student can possibly be an influence to the younger student like for example if the older student wants to be a doctor then maybe, just maybe, the younger student can be influenced and wants to be a doctor when the student is older. I think the effects of older and younger students working together is good because I think that the students can help each other in many things and if a younger student is getting picked on then maybe the older student can defend them and I just think that if older and younger students are paired up then they can work together and help each other on things outside of school. And maybe one of the older student can become perfect friends with the younger one. I honestly think that schools that have programs like this are perfect because students can cooperate with each other and work together and maybe become friends. I really think that students are smarter when they are with other students that are not in there age group.
