I disagree with this statement, because positive attitude is not the solution for all your problems in life there are many problems that you can beat. When you came to this country, and you are alone and don't have help from other people you just can't be positive you don't understand the language and if you are illegal you don't have the many benefits like if you are born here in the united stated you have to hide from the police sometime you can not find a good job because your situation.2. When you lost someone important in your family, and you can't go to set hen because you were in other country etc. you can not be positive for this reason I said what i positive attitude is not good of all.3. If you are from other country some people discriminate you may be they think is easy to be here they don't think about the danger than you have to pass to be here they discriminate you by your skin color and because they think you came to this country just to make money and then came back to your country, but sometimes you came to suicide and make a knew left but many people don't understand that and they rate you so bad and who can have a positive attitude by this reason.4. Yeah! Is right there are many thinks to be positive, like your family, frirnds, girfriend have a good job, graduate from high school is other reason to ve happy and positive but sometimes you just can be positive. Some time when you feel bad, and you have a bad economic situation you cant and with your friendsbecouse they tell you that they can help you because they don't have the resources but some then are loan and if you know it you fell like there are playing with you and that is not a reason to be positive. So my point is that you can be all the positive you can but sometime bad thinks happens like you are immigrant, and you can see your family and that make you be negative.
