Albert Einstein said, "Imagination is more important than knowledge." I do agree because in your imagination you can think or do anything you want. Knowledge is just using your brain, but it's not the same as imagination. Many people might agree with me because it's just true. You can think of many ways; Therefore, all the things you think can come true but not all the time. I'm going to tell you all the reason why! Imagination is a whole new world, not many people can say that. You can create anything just by using your brain. In your mind think of scary movie, funny movie, and horror thing that can scare you. Sometimes you can make up a plan by using your imagination; Meanwhile, you can use your Imagination for homework or any problem that you have at home. Think about it, you are going to love it. Albert Einstein is one of the smartest people if you don't believe me read an article about him trust me. If you use your knowledge what the fun on that you can't even create nothing. Some people just say, use your knowledge for a problem instead of your imagination. Knowledge is important but using your imagination is more important. If you don't believe me believe Albert Einstein! What would you like to use more your knowledge or your Imagination. Well think of the fun thing you can do with your Imagination. Well Albert Einstein would not have said, using your imagination is more important than knowledge. This is my opinion, but it could be your opinion to. You need to try it, I'm telling you it's so fun. Imagination is really fun and helpful in life; However not many people think that, Imagination fun because they never try it. Many people might think it boring and that there no point to it. But there wrong because how do you think that many people got out of their bubble or problem they had in school or home. Just use your imagination It might even help you in life or anywhere. Like I said this is just my opinion no one else.
