I think some people might find visiting a national park enjoyable because it features better activities, and it also attracts more people around the World for example the Grand Canyon or hiking mountains attracts lots of older people from all over the world every single year. But others might like Community parks because there's not that many people like national parks, kids might find community parks more enjoyable because it provides a wide variety of things like Playgrounds, Soccer fields, Basketball courts, etc. and its also free unlike national parks were you have to pay in order to get in. I think an enjoyable way to spend time outdoors is by playing a sport like soccer, basketball etc., in a community park because you can play there any time with friends and family it's also free, you can also meet new people in a park, or you can also join a sports team like a soccer team and play it with your friends which can also lead to scholarships but in order to get that you must train and work hard then you might get in to teams bigger soccer team's, and you might become a Professional player and join big teams like Barcelona, Real Madrid, PSG or other soccer teams, that's what I like to do outdoors and I think other people should stop playing video games, social media, etc. and try something new outdoors because it can change your future and life forever and playing a sport can also help you meet new people travel places, meet soccer stars from all around the world like Spain, France, United Kingdom. Sports are also good for your health running helps your heart, I also like watching soccer games I support Barcelona a team from Spain the reason why I support that team is because they have perfect soccer player like Messi, Luis Su√°rez and Coughing, and they also win trophies like the UEFA Champions League were all the European teams play every year to win the Championship. Also every 4 years there's the World Cup were every Nations soccer team plays to win the World cup. In soccer if you are good at the sport and join a professional soccer team you can get paid up to more than one million! In conclusion who doesn't want to get paid one million dollars for playing an awesome sport and if you're a girl don't worry because there's also soccer teams for girls, and they can also join big soccer teams and make money just like boys, and it's also proven that people who play sports are healthier and have better muscles they also eat healthy foods and fruits and run train every day to burn out calories so that they be in shape when they play in their soccer team's and they why I think someone might find that enjoyable.
