I believe that working in groups benefits more than someone working alone. Working in groups help you gather more knowledge, you get to learn and have fun, and you get to finish faster. When my group comes together, we all start giving each other ideas of our own knowledge to make the project successful. Although some may know more than others, but others may know things that some don't. I also like when my group shares ideas because are project can be much more creative. Some people may believe that someone work alone can also have as much knowledge than someone working in groups. However, I believe that working in groups can benefit you on having more knowledge. Getting together with my group makes learning fun. When we start the project every one would start concentrated so that when we get close to finishing we can talk to each other. People would quietly take a break and talk so that they don't get overwhelmed. . Although, some people may believe that being groups detracts and working alone does not. However, getting detracted is something you would choose to do and not something I would choose to do. I always felt like being in groups time would pass really fast. In a group everyone would choose what they wanna work on or work on something they know more of. When everyone is working on something it reminds me of a job, because every job wants to make the job done as soon as possible. When time flies I feel good because the job is done and I get to relax. Some people may believe that students that work alone like to take there time and do there project at their own style and make it knit. However, I am a type of guy that likes to get my job done and quick, and I believe there is a lot of people that are the same type. In conclusion, working in groups benefits you more because of all of these reasons. Finally, I suggest that every one should try to make or find a group so that all these reasons open up to you.
