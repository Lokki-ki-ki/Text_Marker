To begin with, I am going to be listing my reasons on why I agree to the statement that the former British prime minister Winston Churchill said. In each paragraph I will be supporting my reasons. To start off with, My first reason on why I agree with the statement Is because there Is always a saying that says keep trying to don't give up. When I read this statement I see that saying because you can't give up you got to keep trying to get what you want. Second, With the statement saying "success consists of going from failure to failure' I agree with just for the simple fact that In life you will go through some rough times, and you may not always succeed In what you are trying to do or accomplish, because someone will always fail at something they are trying to accomplish but will keep trying because at some point they will complete what they had tried to accomplish the whole time. Last, Someone can't lose hope of trying to complete something because they will complete it. They have to stay motivated to keep on going and keep on going to complete it. Everyone will be successful but If someone just gives up and doesn't keep trying then they won't get what they wanted to accomplish. Some people don't know that enable to succeed they will fail at it plenty of times, but they would have to keep trying to succeed at it and can't lose hope.
