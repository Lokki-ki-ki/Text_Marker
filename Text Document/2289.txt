As we all know, students love summer break. But what if they were to take that long summer break we once had and make it into a 3-4 week summer break! I would be beyond upset, and I bet other students will too! Personally I don't think it's a good idea. But who am I to judge other people's opinion's. So I'm going to just state some reasons why this not a good idea. First Reason is that many students want a long break from school. And I mean a LONG break from it. The reason to this is because, we get stressed, tired, drowsy, and even suffer from all the studying and work we do year around. And this can cause depression in teens as well, and trust me I know that feeling it sucks. But anyway back on topic. And for the educators that said we should get longer winter breaks and spring breaks it sounds like a good idea, but it just doesn't make sense to me in my opinion. Second Reason is that students spend more time with family and friends! The reason for this is that students don't have time to spend time with them because to 're either doing school work or to 're too tired to even talk, so they go to sleep early because of how tired they are. And when you are tired you feel grumpy and disturbed by everything, so it's better off just going to sleep rather than talking to family and friends because, all your going to bring is negative energy and no one wants that. Final Reason is that summer break is basically like a reward for students that made it through the year. A nice 3 months without work, stress-free, relaxation, and do whatever you want and 3-4 weeks is not enough for us to be honest we need a good long break from it because we just need a little time to relax. And when September arrives it will be a fresh start and are minds will be clear and ready again to do more work. In conclusion these were my statements on why summer break should stay as it is.
