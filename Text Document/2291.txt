"Some schools use cell phones in the classroom for educational purpose think about the effects of allowing students, to have and use cell phones in the classroom. Students think that cell phone use will make easy to study and to get high grades, every teacher, students and parent are debating if they should let students use the phone during class. Cell phones can be used for good reasons like study look for information, that's right that make school easier but at the same time is a distraction for students, because cell phones not only can be used to study, they can be used to communiqu√© play video games and that's a distraction for every student. That makes everything go back works instead of going forward. Also cell phones make easier for teacher to grade, now you can scan papers with phones, and you can make grades for every student, but still is a distraction, am I saying this because I am a student and the same happens to me, I know what it is and I think we should not use cell phones during class not even to do homework or anything relacionated with school. To not have those types of problems we should let have every student have a computer, computer are more useful to search for problems, articles, to write etc. This will make easier school than having phones during class, school should work more on this and all this is for a better if for good of our country to have better jobs better doctors, nurses etc. I disagree on this article because cell phones are a distraction for students, I think that's why computers were made to use, to work, study, applications, papers, images and more, school should make this up and let students use a computer in class better than phone use, like I said do it for a better life, for more knowledge, to be safe and prepared for any circumstances that can show up to life.
