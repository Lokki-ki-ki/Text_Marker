I think it is a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age. My first response is some children can commit to a career at a young age, if they want to improve, and they want a good future, they have to go to school and many of children can help from their parents. For example; if someone wants a career at young age they have to work hard, and pay attention, some time is going to be difficult for them, but they can do it. Children engage in a career at a young age to prepare themselves for their future. Also, is a good idea for students to a career at a young age because they are improved in a good age and they thinking about their future, but in a career at young age some children want to graduate at a young age, first they have to work hard at school, and there are many ways, and programs to be graduated from His School for a career at a young age. In conclusion, kids who take advantage of programs, and High Schools, are qualifying these students for their lives ahead in order to have a good future with a career they want. I definitely think that programs make a positive input in these helping young life.'
