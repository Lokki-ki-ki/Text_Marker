It's a good idea for students to graduate of three years of high school instead of taking for years, I think if they have already passed their classes then they would not have to take elective classes, and they might be able to graduate early, but if they need more than seven classes than they might do not be able to graduate, and they will have to come during summer to complete their classes that they need to pass. For example if they are still missing some of the work they had to complete at the end of the year they would have to come during summer school or maybe take more classes than what they were allowed to be taking. If they need to complete more work they might come during summer break, I think it would be good if you have all your classes that you need in order to graduate since when you come to ninth grade, so at the end of high school you might just come to stool just for maybe two classes, and it would be better for you became you need to pass all your classes either way in order to graduate. And you are assigned with seven SOL and one for English actually you have to be able to pass all the work that you're assigned you must complete all these before you go to the 12th grade, because if you don't complete these assignments before Thatcher you will struggle with these at the end of the senior year of high school, but if you complete all your work that means that you are ready to graduate. For example I am taking four classes that I need to graduate, but I am taking three elective classes because I wanted to learn more, and I did not want to go home early, so I told my counselor I wanted to get three more classes, but it is because I took all the classes I needed to take during the freshman, sophomore and junior year, so now that I am in twelve grade I just have to take just four main classes with are the ones I need in order to graduate. Even tho it would have been a good idea to come in summer because I can learn more, but also would not be a good idea because then I would not be able to graduate on time, or mostly like I would have to come to turn in the work I did not finish during school year, and that would b bad because I want to graduate on time just like the other people that passed all their classes so I need to put that effort and see or talk with the teacher and ask them what do NI need in order to pass all my classes if I am missing some work I have to turn it in. I want to complete all the work due on time because if I do not turn in the work I am assigned to do then that would affect my grades and that will take me away from graduation, with I have been waiting for since ninth grade, So I think it is good to complete your work in class, or if you have homework assigned then we must complete it, or like sometimes the teachers put some work in Google Classroom with dates due, so we must turn the work on time and complete all of it, became if we do not do it our grades are going to go down and that means we will not be passing the classes that we need to pass and that will not let us walk in the stage must complete all the work, if we do complete all that is assigned then we will be good and would not have to worry about our grades because the grades will be good too, that is why I say that we need to complete the work and sometimes pay attention to what the teacher is explaining that helps us to understand and make the work easy, but if we do not pay attention, at the end of the day or at the end of the class we will have problems with the understanding of the theme we have studied in class because we did not pay attention in class while the teacher was explaining. One of the examples of not paying attention in class is, what is going to come next like we are going to get very bad grades, so we must do all the work listen while someone is giving instructions because that way we would not have problems with anything and when the test comes up we are going to be prepared to take it and get high grades, because we already studied and if we review our work before we turn it in and make sure everything is good and in order, so we would get a good grades. So other reason why we get good grades is if we come to school every day because if we miss more than ten days we will get suspended and that will mess up your grades because you are absent, and you will not be able to see or work in the class with is better because if you do not come to school for a couple of weeks than you will not know when you come back to school, you will be lost because you have already missed some work we already did while you was not here, so for me, I rather coming to school even though I am sick or something because otherwise I will bring my grades down and one missing day of school will make all my work come down or bring all my classes down because I have been absent and when I come back to school I would not know what to do. It is good to keep your grades up and stay them in the same level because that will help you TP graduate, so one of my examples is if I come to school and complete all my work, then I do not have to worry about my grades, but UT is not only about your grades or what you do in class is also about what we get in the test and that will be product of the work and effort we put in class if we did good in our notes or study guides that means we will be great in the test too because it is the same that we learn in class it is all the same what will come in the test, so we need to stay focused and ask for help the teacher if we do not understand what we are doing in class. The teachers are able to help in anything we want, well if it is about the classwork because sometimes we do not understand at all, but we can review work and try the best for the next class, we always need to make sure our work is complete before we turn it in because if you have a small mistake that will bring your grades down too, and we will not pass our classes and make sure complete everything, in order to graduate.
