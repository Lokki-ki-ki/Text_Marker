Many people today and day has the problem about how to take decisions is so hardness to take your own decisions, because some people think a lot of what decisions to take that's the principal moment that we need help from someone isn't's matter if your dad, mom or an expert. Sometimes in life you have to take your own decisions because you can fell or not, but you're going to learn what's good or bad, taking your owns decisions it teach you many things about how to take your own decisions with responsibilities. I take my own decisions because that can help me to grow as a person but yes sometimes we need somebody also opinion. However, not everyone thinks like that because they like to ask for and opinion to an expert because, they think that can make you to take the designs easily and that's right but isn't enough for some people because probably they have done before, and it doesn't feel enough for them, because that's the opinion that you're receiving probably you can be agreed or not, but you still are thinking in what decision should they take decisions are not something easy nothing is easy in this life that's one obstacle in life basically is one step that can help you to grow as person because you can learn from bad decision that you have took in the past. Nevertheless, everyone can go to see and expert he or she can give you many types of ideas about what decision you should take but when you depend on someone you will never go to learn how to take decisions by your self, how Say before that is one step the can help you to grow as person, you're growing base on what life is giving you is not matters if is good or bad, but that's how you know what's better for you, and it helps you to grow as a person, makes your life successfully. Moreover, you don't have to take decisions by your self everything is depending on the problem it can not be a problem specifically but in case is very important to count with other person opinion it can make your decision more easy, like my grandfather tell me every time when I talk to him '' be sure of what are you doing'' and what I refer with that is the must be right of what are you doing is so important you always count with friends or someone special in your life those people can make your life better and far away of the problems.
