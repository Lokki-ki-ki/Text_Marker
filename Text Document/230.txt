There is one place I would like to visit is Generic_City because that is a beautiful country there is really great people. At night is really beautiful if you live in an apartment you can see how beautiful it is when I'm bigger I'm going to Generic_City with my girl because I love that country, and it's an awesome country. The food there is perfect and at night you can go in the water with someone it's really fun. The boats are big and small you can ride them, and you can relax. I don't know how much you have to play to ride them all I know is that they are really nice to ride. And I want to go and get on the Eiffel it's really high up, and you can see everything. At night the Eiffel it lights up and it’s really cool because you can see it from ever were because it's really high up.There's and elevator do that you can go really high in the Eiffel you my take some time because it's really high and there may be going a lot of people, so you have to take another ride. For me, it's better to look at night because of the lights it's really cool. At daytime is nice but it does't have the lights, so I like it when it's nighttime. But the thing I don't like about nighttime it's that you can go but in the elevator. The food is perfect they eat a lot of things they eat bread at any time of day. They have café's there are perfect. But Paris is really different form a lot of country's. They have perfect chafes that make perfect food that you are going to love. They have awesome food.
