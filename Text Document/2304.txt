I disagree with it because cell phone can distortion to students, school may not be allowed to use cell in classroom, and they will lazy to do work. First, Now a day many students are failing classes because most of the teacher allow to students use cell phone during they are teaching. If students may allow using cell phone then they can distortion by study, and their force can be in phone. When we keep use phone then we can't listen what teacher saying. For explain, last year in my history class we can allow using phone so, when go to history class I away use my phone and I never listen to teacher. I fail the class and sol because of use cell phone every day. School may not be allowed to use cell phone in classroom because if school allow to use cell phone in classroom then students may not be able to learn anything. If students are allowed to use cell in school, then when students are doing testing they might be change to chat on test. Students can leave study, they gonna force on play phone. Finally, When students have work in classroom they are so lazy to do it because they are busy to play game or use phone. In school, we have a lot of work to do, if teacher give us using phone then students might not do it. So, we have work then teacher should not give us using phone because lots of students are busy with phone or play game. While, Many students are distortion by cell phone because they can't force on study. They think teacher give us to use phone so, we don't have to do anything, and they don't do homework, classwork and study. That the mind reason school should not allow using phone, it is good sometime to use phone but not when we have work to do.
