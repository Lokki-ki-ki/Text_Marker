In my opinion, the students tanking to attend classes from home, by way of line or video conferencing. I think the students not have benefit from being able to attend classes from home. First, the students has more distraction in home; with video play, and the action, more students work a time with taking a class, more with have a class in distance, the schools need a tanking an other options. With learn in school the students are more specific learn, with a have a teacher opposite the student to learning more specific, when she's tanking the classes to has a more effective for a student. Second, I link this option for learning offer the class in distance with an attend classes from home; not is a good option for example: in my house a have three brothers, and one sister, I think is distraction with learning in home. In finally; with reason with not is good idea the learning a distance the school, I think is more elementary, basic to taking the video conferencing online, because; learning more in the watch the video conference, with online; is more effective memorize with the morning in not in evening, the students have forceful in the morning, but no think this is a good option for a student, not have a good benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Conclucion; the students not taking the classes from the house or distance learning, but students learning more when she goes to the schools. The parents think exactly with me, because is the most effective taking the classes in the schools, in not a distance the schools.
