I strongly disagree with extending the school days. Longer school days can have a great impact on students. It also makes class hours long. Most students like to have short classes. Longer school days can make students, exhausted, have less free time, and hate school. Longer school days will not make students happy. Longer school days can make students exhausted. Longer school day causes the classes to be longer. Which most students get tired of being in the same class for a long time. Students get tired of doing a lot of work in class which make them want to do less work. Students will be exhausted which will make them not go outside. By extending school days students will not have free time. Most students like to spend time with their family and friends. However, longer school days can take that privilege away. Longer school days can take away students free time. Most of the year it can get dark outside early, and students won't be able to go outside after they come from school. Since students won't have enough free time to go outside they will hate going to school. Students will hate going to school when there is longer school days. Because students like to have less class time. Also, students would want to do less work. Students wouldn't want to be in their least favorite class for a long time. If the school hours get longer students would not want to come to school. Also, some students would skip the classes they didn't like. By adding hours to the school days students will be, tired, they won't be able to have free time, and they will not want to be at school. Students will hate school if the hours get longer. Students will not enjoy school. Also, classes would have a lot of work in one day which would make them not want to come to school. In conclusion there should not be one and a half hour added to school days.
