It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change. I agree with this statement because it gives a perspective of how you are in your life, demonstrate how your personality is, and shows your live conditions. It gives a perspective of how you are in your life because it shows the type of person you are, if you are a irresponsible person or a bad person, and the manner of take the problems that came forward in your life. For example, if you have a job, and you are constantly absent for work, it gives a bad impression because it demonstrates you are irresponsible, and the people can think bad things about you. Demonstrate how your personality is because it shows how you can be with the people and demonstrate how you really are. For example, if you are honest and kindness with the people, they can trust you and have positive thoughts about you. Shows your live conditions because it demonstrates if you have personal cleanliness, if you care of your self etc. For example, if you go for an interview for apply in a job, and you not take a bath every day, they would have a bad impression of you, and maybe they not accept you in the job, and that led to the people bad comments about you. Clearly, the prompt is correct because is how you show how you are in your life, how is your personality, and your live conditions.
