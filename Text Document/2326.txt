Students idea to change the school menu would benefit them a lot. This is going to help students a lot, they will focus more at school. I think it is a good idea to change to a new, healthier school lunch menu. First of all, if students received healthier lunch, It's going to help them a lot. For example, it would make students to be on task and be focused on their classes. They will help students to get good grades and to keep students active in all their classes. Changing school lunch menu will have a big impact in students, more people will start to get food and It's going to help their brain to think more. My second reason is students prefer good food than healthier food the taste nasty. In addition, mostly all students would prefer to eat regular food the is healthier. However, it doesn't have anything to do with your body if you don't want to be fat because of the food you received, that's because you don't care about your body. Students will have to start worrying about their body not about the food they eat. My last reason is about the benefits of receiving healthier school menu at school. For example, students will enjoy more their lunch. Students would choose what to eat and students would have time to interact with theirs friends while they eat their lunch. In conclusion, I think is a good idea for school to change the lunch menu. Students are going to focus more and students would be on task in school.
