Dear Principal of Generic_School:The change of the menu at the cafeteria might be a good idea but also might be a bad idea for some students, the idea to have a new menu at the cafeteria should be made it first in a debate with all the students at the auditorium, students can have the right to vote if they would like to have a new menu at the cafeteria, they might give a vote for which kind of food can be removed and which kind of food should to stay, or they can decide if you will be better to not make a change at the cafeteria, making this plan will not have any impact in students or school to choose they food or making a change because they will have the opportunity to decide what is good and what is not good for them. Making this plan, students will feel comfortable to decide good things for their school, students can also share ideas with you and make different plans for a good change at the cafeteria, just think about it and you will see good results in students of your school. If students decide to have a different menu of food..." This might be a great idea for student to try different kind of food and make this change every year, the good thing about making this is that student will not feel tired for be eating the same kind of food every year."" Students will feel excited every day to go to the cafeteria and see the new menu of food at the cafeteria."" Some students might have a favorite food, but they can try different varieties of food and have new favorite food.""Also, will be a great idea to give 35 minutes of lunch instead of 25 minutes, students can share time with them friends, have more time to finish if they have any work class or homework to do."" Students can enjoy the free time to eat with no rush. Making a change will be an idea that all might students they'll support it.", I hope you consider this idea as a good idea and students may consider it this as a good idea too, also think about the good change that you can make for students to have better time at school and enjoying they lunch will be great to fill they energy and get back to class. Sincerely:Students at Generic_School
