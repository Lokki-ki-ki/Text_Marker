Some peoples hose for a four work week model, should be this one be taken as practice at schools. In this option there are many people who think this is a benefit to conserve energy in whatever place. I think that this practice could be disadvantage because it will be two more hours of work, between longer day, the students will be using more energy in those ten hours every day. Then, we have to use more resources at school for the students be working in class those resources could be naturals, we could be wasting many papers, water when we are in the school, and we have to make progress of this kind of resources. Also, ten hours each day we will be wasting resources as electricity every class could be using computers, monitors,tablets, and we have to find a way how to save these resources at school. In conclusion all of this are my reasons and explanation by this model of how to conserve energy and resources at schools.
