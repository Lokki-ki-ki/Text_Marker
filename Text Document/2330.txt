I didn't hear much about that, but what I read in this prompt is that "some high schools districts offers programs that allow high schools students to graduate early instead of four years", it means that they should have extra classes in summer, and they are not able to take elective courses. These are my thoughts that I have:First, I can see that they don't have a brake to relax (except winter brake and some holly days, sometimes teachers give students homework for winter brake), they are always studying hard, so they get stress. Second, usually they have a lot of homework, that's one of the reason that they don't really have time to their families and friends; they can get depress too and start feeling alone, that's what usually happen to me. After that, they are done with the school early, so they have one year to chill or may have a part-time job, except that their parents make them join to college early. They keep studying, and then sometimes people have to move from house, because the college is at another state or city, so they have to rent a room close to the college. In conclusion, graduate in less time is better and worst at the same time, but people know what they do with their lives, in my opinion I prefer to graduate like a normal student, in four years.
