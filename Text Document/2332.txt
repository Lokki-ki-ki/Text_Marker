First impressions will always change because you don't know the persons true color's yet. A lot of people act so nice on their job interview, but later on that first impression is going to change. On the first day of school teacher's act to nice but, later on in the school year the teacher's first impression is going to change. For example, when you first meet the person they act so friendly and so nice until you really get to know them, they start changing. You will see the persons true colors if they act the same and do what they first did when you met them. Finally, first impressions going to change because some people just act to do good on their first impression. For example, people dress and act good at their job interview. When they finally get that job, first impression is going to change because they are going to keep calling off and not work hard enough as they said in the interview. Finally, when the manager see's that you changed your first impression you will get fired. For example, on the first day of school teacher's act so nice and tell you how the year I going to go. After that, the teacher's start getting tough on you and giving you more assignments. Finally, it's a proven fact that teacher's change their first impression. In conclusion, I agree that first impressions change because it's a proven fact and anybody in this world can tell you first impressions change because you don't know there true colors.
