Prime Minster Winston Churchill once said that "success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm." This quote inducted that becoming successful is a lie in life that does not have challenges, failures and have hard time in life to active your goals and, without making it interesting. However, a lot of people believes this quote, because success is nothing with having enthusiasm and, losing or being fail on something and being positive about it. First, Having successful life without challenges is result of being fail in your success. The reason why you should have challenges in life to become a successful It's to make you a better person in life and to make you a critical thinker and to garner your all skills and your talents for the better future. For example if you face your challenges later in life you would have the benefits from that hard or easy challenges. Secondly, making you challenge interesting would lead to become successful, the reason why because having interning and positive attire towards your challenge would make it easier to handle. For example if your losing a business or challenge do not bring native atmosphere around it because it would never let your mind have more opportunity that you could have done more. In my point of view, failing or losing is lie if you do not try hard for the interesting and successful goals. If you are losing a challenge it okay to loss but with positive thought and never give up on the difficult challenge you have to face in you way to successful life and jails. However, a lot of people gives up on the difficult challenges because It's too hard for them to handle and at end they would have more difficult thing to face. Make your challenges interesting it does not matter if you fail it is matter how you play it.
