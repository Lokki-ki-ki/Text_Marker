I think it's better to talk to more people than just one person, why became different people have a different way of viewing a situation. People act different, one person might be angry and the other might be happy. That's one of the reasons why I think it's better to talk to more people than just one person. You can see how different people think by just starting a conversation, different people might have better advice than others became of the way they think or how they were taught to do things. It's also good to talk to the people that have been through your situation became they have been through it, and they can give you tips on how to be positive or how to be relaxed in that situation if it ever happens again. You can also talk to your family members became they are close people that you can always trust to help you like a project or just homework things like that so it doesn't stress you out so much. It's good to know that someone will always be there to help you out. That's way I think it's better to talk do different people not just one person. THE Insincerely; Generic_Name
