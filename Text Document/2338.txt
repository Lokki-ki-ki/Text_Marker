Technology allows people to complete many tasks without having contact with others. People can use technology for read a book, watch TV show, shopping, play games, and people can contact random people whenever they want. First, A Lot of people reading a book and watch TV show or video on the phone. When I was in Generic_City, I saw the lot of people read a book with their phone or tablet, Also they are still watching a video almost every time when they are in the vehicle, but this is not a negative effect on peoples lives. This is positive effects on peoples lives, because they are still reading a book. Second, many of student are not doing homework or not focus on their school, the main is they are not doing homework and play video game, Also they are using a phone or listen music while middle of the class. Or some people not studied and cheating on the test or quiz. But they will get a good grade, but they don't know what they learned. Finally, Old people doesn't know about technology, so some bad people using a technology for old people, and they get money from old people. This thing still happening lot of country, like Korea. I saw my grandmother happened too. They took $1000 from my grandmother, and they got busted. This is awful negative effects on peoples lives. So technology is half negative effects and half positive effects, So whoever use technology for negative effects. I wish they are stop, and use for good place.
