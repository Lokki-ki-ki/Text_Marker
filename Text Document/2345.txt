Why some the teachers let it happen well they sometimes don't know that is happening. Students who take out their phones right in the open will get caught easy. Other students try to hide them so no other teacher can't see them. Some other kids will even sneak glance at bag or pockets or even in their bag pack. Teachers will even get the student with their phones out red-handed. Even with their phones out students barely pay attention in class or at were there going. Some parents will even get some complains from the school that their kids had their phones out. The parents will have to go the school to pick up there children phone.
