When there's a problem it's a chance for you to do your best. I agree with this statement because when you in a problem you give up, you don't know what to do, and you try your best to find out why its hard or why it's a problem. When I play soccer there was one problem, I never passed the ball to my teammates. The coach always got mad at me for not passing the ball. Sometimes I gave up because I forget to pass the ball. There was no way that I can remember to bass the ball. The coach always tells me in every game to pass the ball. I don't know what to do to remember to pass the ball. If the other team has it I attack to get the ball but when I get it on my feet I can't pass because it's hard. The only thing I can do is go in Google or YouTube, so it can help me. Sometimes I don't know what to do to get better, its hard watching YouTube or going to Google is the only thing I can do to get batter, or not forget to pass, and help me. I search up "why do I never pass the ball and how can I get better to pass or not forget to pass the ball." It helped me a lot, and now I started trying my best to get better at soccer and it's going good so far. Every game I have passed the ball. When you have a problem it's your chance to try/succeed. When you have a problem you need to try your best, try not to give up, and try not to get confuse, or it will be even harder for you.
