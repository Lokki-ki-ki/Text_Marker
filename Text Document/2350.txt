They are many things or ways one, or a family can spend their time when outside or their time in the outdoors. And also will see that activity to be fun at the same time and will like to do it all the time. One of the activities that one can do outdoors is going to the community park to have some fun alone or with their family to enjoy the environment and leave their life the way they want to, also they can take their dog with them and have fun with them some activities they can be doing with the dog is training them how to jump, catch things, and also how to make friends with other dogs in the area of the park they are. And also if they go alone they can also have some alone time on their own or even make friends with other people who also brought their dogs with the, and by this they will have some fun outdoors and also find that going to the park was a fun idea. Another way to have fun or spend time outdoors is to go to the beach on your free time to clear your mind from all the things you did on workdays like from Monday to Friday, having all this kind of stuff on your shoulder at work I think that this will be the best time to go to the beach. But if you think that in your opinion that my first point I made about going to the beach was not the best idea then I think the second point may be the best reason why someone will have interest in going to the beach. The main reason why someone will go to the beach is to have the best time of his or her life or maybe find someone that the person is attractive to when they go to the beach.
