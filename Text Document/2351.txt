Ralph Waldo Emerson is the author. He wrote, "Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow." I agree with his statement. Because he didn't give up to write a statement. For example, Generic_Name wanted to give up for the driving lesson. But Generic_Name thought, "If I am not going to take the driving lesson anymore, I can't go far anywhere." So, he didn't give up and took the driving lesson. After that, he got a driver's license. After he got a driver's license, he can drive anywhere. He drives very well after he took the driving lesson. Another example, Generic_Name wants to be a scientist. So, she is studying a science. Also, she is doing lab with the experiment materials in the laboratory. But, there are many hard science problems, and experiment materials. So, she wants to give up, and get another job that can do easy way. But, she decided to don't give up for her job. So, she didn't give up to be a scientist. She studied hard, and researched how to succeed in the experiment. After she did that, she got a job scientist. She realized, "If I give up, I can't do something later." So, she is doing hard for her job, scientist. When you give up, it will be hard to succeed, and get the benefit.
