I think that the principal should not change the school policy because there are many students in school that the only thing that make them happy is sports; and that is what makes them stay away from trouble. But if you take that away from them there going to have nothing and they won't be looking forward to going to school. And they may feel that they are not good in anything but sports; and it motivates you to be better in school it teaches you how to cooperate with other student, how to be a good leader/captain, and many more. That's why I think that the principal should not change the school sports policy.
