I think this program should be in every school because this could help the younger students to learn more about the school. And the older students can the younger students, and they can show them which room they have to go. And its better this way because the older students knows more things about the school then the younger students do. And this could help the younger students learn more about the school. This will make the students feel about their held because they were helping other younger students. Now the students feel more comfortable because they got helped from the other students from the other students, so now the younger students feel way happier because they know where to go. And if this was not a thing students will be all sad and frustrated because they will be all lost because they knew to the school and won't have no one to help them. The younger students going to be really sad because they wouldn't know what to do and what class they have to go. So this is a reason of why every older students should help new kids at the school or any younger students. And the younger students going to learn from the older students and this program can help the younger students get their grades up because older students can help them do they work and get their grades up
