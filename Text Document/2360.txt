In school there are a lot of fun and educational activities. One of my favorite activity to do in school is a science experiment. In science there are a lot of awesome experiments and tools you can use, and they are fun to use. If there wasn't any fun science experiments; I wouldn't like to go to science. Some kids say that science is the worst subject in school, and it is boring. In my opinion science has a lot of cool stuff that you can't do in any other fun activity in school. My most favorite experiment is when we are mixing chemicals because you don't have a major clue of what is going to happen when you mix them up, and that is what makes it interesting and fun at the SMA time. There are more experiments that you do in science like making a volcano eruption or something else, but science can be fun if you pay attention to what the teacher is saying and following the rules because there can be fun, but there has to be rules or somebody can get hurting conclusion there might be some better educational activities but in my opinion I like more science experiments, however, it does get boring sometimes, and you just don't want to do anything, therefor, you just can't complain about life, you just got to with it and enjoy it.
