Everyone has a talent or skill. In my case, Its music. Although my music skills are still improving, I would still consider it a talent or skill. I've learned to play different instruments such as: the guitar, percussion, xylophone, and the violin, which is what I'm currently playing. At first, I joined chorus in 1st grade and finished in 5th grade. I really enjoyed it, so I chose to learn an instrument, which ended with me joining band. In band, I learned how to play the recorder. I played it from 2nd grade to 3rd grade. After learning the recorder I switch instruments to a xylophone, that played during 4th grade. Since I didn't really like playing the xylophone, I chose to do percussion for 5th grade. I was also learning the guitar during 4th grade through 5th. When I entered middle school I decided to turn things around by choosing to do orchestra. I learned everything I had to know in 6th grade, so I was ready to play the violin in 7th grade. I really felt passionate about the violin, so I kept playing, and still am, and yet will continue until high school. My music skills can be useful at times, for example: my parents once asked me to play a song for their wedding, they thought it was marvelous. Last year, I sang a song, that I composed, for my sisters' birthday. She really enjoyed it. I like participating in music contests, concerts, etc. This year I went to New York for a violin concert, it was amazing. My music skills have yet to improve, but until then I will continue trying new ways of music.
