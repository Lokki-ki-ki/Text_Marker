What would happen if school offer the program to student that qualify for the program that only take three year of high school instead of the four years. Here are some examples, and reason why is a good idea for school to offer this types of programs. Reason number one is that students that had A's and B's in the past years like middle school and the beginning of high school maybe qualify for the three year instead of the four year of high school, because they are so intelligent hat they not need the four years of high school. Reason number two is that if they graduate from high school they may like to apply for a community service for there college application. Reason number three is that some students don't have the money to pay for college, so they may need a year to save some money to pay for college, or some student may not like college, so they are only going to finish high school, and they are going straight to work, and the more experience you learn form a job the better it is so is a good idea to begin at a younger age. So I think that the program that school offer to student for them to take the opportunity to graduate early from high school is a good idea because it will help them a lot in there life.
