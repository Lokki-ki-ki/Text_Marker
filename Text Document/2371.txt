Have you ever felt board, or idle? Thomas Jefferson ones wrote," Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing." I strongly agree with Thomas, because when I'm feeling idle. I intend to get sad, or depressed, therefore never be idle.There's a lot of ways you can stay active and not be board out of your mined, for example; over the summer my Dad took me to work with him, as a carpenter. But not every one can do that, therefore here are some ideas for you: go to a gym, go for walks, or get a job. Going to the gym might be a big comment, but its very healthy physically and mentally, you'll start feeling good about your self, maybe even start looking good too. This is my first idea in how to stop being idle. My second idea is walking. Walking was something that helped me fined my peace, just walking around admiring the world, breathing in the fresh air; now I'm not saying to do it alone maybe with a friend or two, or maybe walk your dog. Pretty must enjoy the beautiful world that gods given us. My third and last idea are to find a job. Working with my Dad has given me a lot of money, I bought nice shoes, cloths and bought my family things too, but it wasn't just about the money. Working with my Dad really has given me another way to look at life, gave me a reason to change my ways and made me see that the real life isn't easy. And It's amazing to see the building now, to see how much it's improved from last time I was there and now it's just like a maze to me. This is why I believe it's never okay to be boarded, or idle. Because just imagine all the things you can get done, therefore, this is I think Thomas Jefferson right when he said," it is wonderful how much you can get done if we are always doing."
