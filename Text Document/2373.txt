Dear principal, If you don't like to leaving in a place were there is lots of people that litter then I think you would be able to tell some friends to do some community service is a very good idea because it helps keep your town or city clean. I think that we should start to do community service because a lot of people litter, and it is awful for our oceans and if we clean litter up we will keep oceans clean, and it will be safe for the fish. The end
