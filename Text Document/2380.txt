I think we should have phones in school only when we have free time on our own and when we are in class we should finish our assignment first and that's when we should have phones out. Including our music we would like to here it only when we are taking a test, or we are doing an assignment quite and that you won't bother any people. If we abandoned the phones they would still not follow direction so why even try to abandon them, that's why I say we should allow the school to have phones out in there free time and if they catch us with the phones they should not take them away. They should just say can you please put your phone away.
