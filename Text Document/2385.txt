Albert Schweitzer the philosopher, physician, and humanitarian is great at motivating people by saying, "Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing. What he means from that is everyone behavior is different. When it comes to behavior anybody could act different. Behavior influences some people. When it comes to influence it often affects a person or events. Albert Schweitzer is a very successful man, and he probably accomplished that by having influence in him self and believing on what he is capable of. Say one day I was having a rough day and somebody asks me, "hey, do you want to know something" or if they are being very annoying your attitude and behavior is going to change into something bad. Yes behavior could change somebody attitude and that's not good and that's what he's trying to say. Albert Schweitzer is setting good examples for people who struggle and people who really needed to hear his example. Everything that Albert said in that quote is very true. Always setting good examples are a good and great way to influence somebody in many ways as what he just told us in his quote. Albert Schweitzer probably learned in the past and maybe that's what he's trying to tell us to watch our future that is ahead of us in time.
