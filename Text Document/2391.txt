Churchill consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm, he said that because he wants to animate people to not be shy of anything, and I'm are with that. Some say Churchill goes from failure to failure without loss enthusiasm because sometimes people feel shy when they are doing something that they don't want to do, like me. I'm so shy when I have to do presentations, I don't feel comfortable. But we have to get out our fears, that are killing us to not do what we have to do. People sometimes said that they're going somewhere, but they said that they don't want to go alone because he/she feels weird, like if you are new in this country, they tell maybe to their cousins to go with him/her. People should be agreed with Churchill statement about the important role that failure play in the pursuit of success because that makes you feel successes and that makes you to be a good person. Actually, Churchill said that because he wants to people to not lose their enthusiasm in something that they want and that is a good choose.
