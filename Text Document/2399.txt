I think that honesty is so important because, being honest can make you gain trust from others. Honesty makes life easier it helps by telling the truth everyone can get along. What ever the situation is good or bad you still have to tell the truth because it is good for everyone and, yourselves. When your honest more people can trust you and, the more people that trust you the best of a person you are. However, when it comes to suicidal thoughts or someone isn't feeling good tell the truth to an adult even though your friend told you not to you did a great thing for your friend, you might have saved his life. You can always tell the truth because being honest is always helpful and, good because, you did a good thing. Being honest is needed everywhere because if everyone was a liar our country wouldn't be good. Telling lies is not good for you, it's a bad habit for you and, once you lie a couple of times you will continue to lie over and, over. Whatever it's about lying is never the answer to solve problems it makes it worse. You loose trust, you don't get anything out of it, and you just seem like a bad person by lying. For example, say you stole something, and it was your friends toy. You decided to take him when he left it there and, he asks you "Have you seen my toy", The best option is to give it back or tell him that you have it don't lie and take it. It doesn't matter how badly you want if it's not yours. The boy's mother bought him that, and it wouldn't be nice to just take it from him. The boy would feel sad and, the mother would not like that too and, you wouldn't feel good after because lying hurts. Telling the truth is always the right choice to do in any occasion.
