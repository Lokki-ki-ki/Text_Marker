I really think that if we want to be success in life, we have to be positive on everything, a lot of famous people said that for example, Michael Jordan said: the key to the success is to be positive. We have to be positive on everything that we do if we have a negative attitude everything is going to be negative, maybe we are going to fail, but that is another key to the success, that means we are doing everything well, but if we fail, we have to keep trying and never give up, until we get what we want, Michael Jordan said: I fail a lot of times but, that is the reason why I am who I am. There is going to be bad moments in the journey, but that does not mean that we are done, we have to be positive and think positive, because for everything there is a solution. But another key to the success is to be humble, when we get what we wanted we have to remember from where we come, be positive is important, but be humble is the most important thing. But the most important thing follow your dreams and never stop fighting for them, until you get what you want. I am agree with this statement: It has been said that a positive attitude is the key to the success in life.
