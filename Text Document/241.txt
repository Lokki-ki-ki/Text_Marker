Dear Generic_Name, Our school gave opportunity to us, students, that will allow us to explore occupation through your internship. Although, some people may say that it will just be a waste of time for students but for me it's not. As a student I don't want to miss any opportunity given to me that will help me to be more prepared for the future, give me more experience, and lead me to success. Firstly, this internship will help me be prepared more for the future. Since I'm still young I still haven't made up my mind on what kind of job I wanted to have, so through this internship I will have the chance to explore the occupations that I can get and make up my mind and have a decision. Therefore, this internship will help me on being ready for the future. Secondly, this internship will give me more experience. Experience is a great way for learning and discovering new things. There's this saying that "You will never know until you try". For example, my friend hated the thought of her dancing but when one of our teachers asked us to dance, she discovered that she was perfect at dancing. Through this internship I may discover things that never really crossed my mind but actually good at it. Thirdly, this internship will help me lead to success. This internship will help me plan for my future and not just do anything that will cross my mind. After this internship I already know what job I should get, know what to do and what to expect, and be more confident and more prepared. This internship will lead me to success because it will help me boost up my confidence and help me do better on my future job. If I were to be selected I will do my best and everything I can for this internship because I don't want to miss the chance of being prepared for the future, get more experience, and most importantly will lead me to success.
