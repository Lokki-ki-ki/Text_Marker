A homework club is a great opportunity for students who have a difficult time understanding their work. Sometimes work can be hard and not everyone can understand it. Homework clubs can help students understand their work better and have more confidence with it. The homework club would have to start at the end of the day when everyone has their homework, the club can be from 3:00pm to 5:00pm that way students have 2 hours to get their work done and have time to chill out at home. I am sure that many other people agree that we should have a homework club. We all know this would be a great opportunity for students that have a difficult time understanding their work. Homework clubs can also help students improve grades which will then lead to higher test scores all because students will get extra help and have someone who will help them understand their work better. I am sure that starting a homework club will lead students in a great path to success and wealth.
