I think that working with a group is way better, because working with a group gives you a better understanding of what you are doing and helps you to be more focus. it's can also be very important when you have your teammates around you that if there is any mistake you and your teammates can come together and try to solve that issue. And also working with a group can be very beneficial. Because working with a group can also make u feel confident and makes you good at social interactions. So that when u go out in the world you already know how to interact with your boss and coworkers. And working with people can also make u grow not physical but to grow as a person and to make u more mature and to make u have a better understanding of life and of your responsibilities. So I feel that as a young adult coming up in this world. I would like to have my work experience with a group. That way I can be more aware, focus and to be more understanding of my environment that I'm working in and that I can learn not just from my self but learn from the people around me. Working with a group can also be fun you can work with kids your age, or you can work with people older than you. It can teach you self awareness, kindness towards others and its can influence you in so many ways because if you are working with people older than you are going to start acting more mature and want to live up to your teammates expectations. And also working with a group can improve on manners, behavior,self-esteem, self conduct and politeness. Working in group is very important you can have experience and learn a lot from other people it also teaches you what to expect and how to prepare for it in the future. It also teaches you how to act around others and teaches you the importance of life so I think that working with a group is better it teaches you better, and you can learn better.
