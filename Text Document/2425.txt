One place in the world I would like to visit is Generic_City, Peru. The reason I want to visit Peru is that my grandma and my dad live there, I haven't seen them in 7 years and I want to see them at least one more time until I grow up. Once I arrive I want to spend some time with my grandma and my dad to catch up what has happened over the years. I also want to go to the beach and the pool and go to the park with my whole family and have an awesome picnic, and we would makes mores and tell creepy stories, also I would want to get a tan, but one of the things I haven't done ever in my life is skydiving I know it would be terrifying, but it would also be really fun to see their reaction when the jump out of a plane it would be hilarious to watch it over and over again. The last place I would visit is Machu Picchu because it is such a clam place. At night, you see the stars and in the morning u see the sunset rising. I would never want to leave. To sum up I would have an amazing time with my family. Because I would visit Peru I would see my cousins, brothers,grandma, aunts,uncle and my dad I would see them every day, and we would spend some family time together. When I go to the beach we are going to have a picnic we are going to go swim also we are going to play some games we are going to have a blast ! I am going to visit Machu Picchu. The first thing I would do is watch the sunset, ride camels, ride horses and take awesome pictures.
