It's important to learn from the experiences of others whether it's a good experience or a bad experience. My mom told me once that it was hard for her to go to school and that was all because she was the women of the house. And she had to do so much work and that was not easy for her every day. Having to cook for many other people and do work for school was really hard even when she would try to do her best it was not easy for her. Knowledge, Judgment, and Succeed are part of experiences from others as well you might have that in yourself. Knowledge to know and keep in mind that maybe that person you learn something from put so much effort into it or maybe not. Judgment is part of learning to never judge somebody whether its wrong or right. To succeed from that experience to do better, to learn and to know that from that experience you can succeed and keep in mind what to do good.It's a good thing to learn from experiences. You might as well relate to their experience that maybe you did not even know you could relate to. Sharing wisdom with somebody is always a good idea. I think it helps people to improve and succeed and learn from mistakes and learning new and different things. In other words, sharing your experiences with somebody brings a connection between you and that person. Sharing your experiences and what you had to go through and knowing the other person know that it was not easy to be successful, there was a lot of work done to put on to be able to succeed.
