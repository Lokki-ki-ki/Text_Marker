Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm? it's a 50% chance you will be successful, reason for this is that some people give up too easily, some people get tired of failing and failing again. You don't need to fail many times before you get successful. Some people never put in work to be successful as they are today some just became successful out the cut. Right now the world we live in you don't really need to put in a lot of effort, there are many ways of being successful for example we have social media! Social media now has a big impact in the world we live in. Scientists are perfect examples of this statement. A scientist can start an experiment and fail over and over again till they get they expected the results. Students can fail a test over and over again but whiles he's failing he's learning from his mistakes to pass his test. Working on something new or getting used to something new, you won't get it right the first time you would mess up or fail but once you keep getting used to it, you learn from your mistake which helps you to become successful. If you ask most successful people of today, some might respond by saying they experienced a lot of failure on the way to the top some might respond with a no, this states that failure might play a role in being successful it may also not play a role in being successful.
