They are so awesome. Another place I would go to is Sea view. It's a beach. There I could go on horse and camel rides. The rides are exhilarating. About three or four people can ride the camel at the same time. They take you all the way to the water than back to where you started. Another place I would go to is Safari Park.

There I will order a chicken burger with yummy fires and soda. When night comes around it will be time for dinner. For dinner, I will go to a local restaurant. There I will order steaming hot Chicken Korma with buttery naan and Mango Lassie. For desert, I will have hot gulabgamun. They are like little doughnut balls covered with sugar syrup, and are very soft. As you can see, Pakistani cuisine is very delicious. The people are very nice in Pakistan. Wherever you go you would see people helping out each other. They are very welcoming and kind. They treat each other like they all are equal. Furthermore, they laugh, talk, and they just have fun.
