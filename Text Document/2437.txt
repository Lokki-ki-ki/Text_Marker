To conserve energy and resources, some businesses have adopted a four-day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours. Is not a perfect idea, It's important to conserve energy, but only in that sense. Because for some students is going to be very boring, and they do not want to go to school, that is why is not a perfect idea to change the schedule. First at all, the students will be really upset, because who want to be at school for ten hours. Second, it's the same if you come five days per week for eight hours, to come four days per week for ten hours. Third, the business if different from a school, because if a school only open four days per week, are going to be the same if they open five day per week, because the teachers leave one or two hours after the students. The students will be really upsets, because who not to be, nobody wants to be at school for ten hours, many students had a part-time job after school, if the school want to choose that option of four-day for ten hours, so the students who have a job. They are going to lose their jobs because at the new schedule. It is the same if we come to school five days or four days, it's the same time that we spend on school, and then the teachers leave one or two hours later than us. So, is not too much the energy or resources that the school would be conserved if they change the five-days for eight hours to four-days for ten hours. In conclusion is the same thing if they change the five-days for the four-days of school, because they are going to spend the same time or maybe more than they think, but not is a good idea, for the students who have a part-time job after school. They don't want to lose their jobs for that change, and is going to be the same charge if they change the schedule. That is why is not a good really idea for school.
