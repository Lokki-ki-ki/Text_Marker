When I think about and enjoyable activity, I think about sports, and the reason why it's because a lot of people find sports as a fun way to be healthy and make them feel better of them self by being physically active, I also believe that any sport is a good example to learn from others as well as your self, and for I know sports is not all of just about competing against other teams and winning or loosing, is very helpful if we're talking of team work. One of the most enjoyable activities in the world it's sports, in some way many kind of sports have proof that it's a real entertainment thing to do and to be as much healthy then doing a diet from a doctor's recommendation, people actually agree that if there's something that might have a plethora of fun and includes a reason to be healthy in daily life it's sports, a 78 % of people in planet Earth consider and invited people to joy a sport for the good of others and good of your self too. Sport it's a specific activity that in cases have help people feel better about who they are, how they look, and the way it has change people globally, most of the time a person doesn't know what they like to do even thought they try other stuff like being smart, video games, music etc., they feel like they don't belong or fit in something, but at the end they go along about what other friends says about sports and find them self the right place to be. Sports as a good educational activity example of learning about others as learning from your self, is very important when getting a job that consist in the statement of knowing other people, like being a teacher, a teacher doesn't get a job without presenting him/her in general to his/her teachers partner, or teach a class without presenting to the students in classes they'll be taking, they will also ask a new student to present him/her self to every one in the classroom, teachers mostly do with their classroom as a coach will do with his team in a sport. These two educational activities are alike to each other in the simple reasons that they both teach their learners to get to know each other and get along with one another, another way that they're alike is that they're preparing them for the big challenges, an English teacher prepared the students for the big writing SOL as a soccer coach prepared the players for the final game of the season.However, it's not only learning from others, many times sports definitely let you learn more about yourself, it takes out the person who you truly are it will also take all those stuff that you had no idea you knew, doing sports can have experiences in which you'll learn from. Team work is the hard work that a group does together to complete their goal, it's not about the leader or the best member of the group, what most matter in team work is work as a group no matter the worst or best you do. If you ever play a sport you might know that the main thing to do is team work, for example football, if one of the football players has the ball, he can't go across the field and do a touch-down if his teammates don't do anything to stop the defenders of the other team that wants to knock him out, but if they decided to play the game by doing team work he would have made a touch-down because he's teammates would have help him pass through by knocking the defenders. Sports team around the whole world has an immense number of followers, followers keep on touch with them because they have something relative to it or because they had won a lot of times, and this is thanks to the strategy they do (team work),In conclusion sports are not only of competing against others, is something that is productive in the way that you don't only get a metal or a good job, sports are also to have fun with friend or even with people you don't know, and it's a perfect way of being healthy and be able to do two things at the same time, it also helps us understand other people that needs it as you do with your teammates by knowing them and getting along with them, in sports you can learn from your self when you make a mistake, and finally in any kind of sport you will have to know how to play as team work because that's what matters in teams. There is a lot of other educational an enjoyable ting to do, but I think sports are one of the best ones.
