Hello, my name is Generic_Name. I'm student in the Generic_School, and the reason for this letter is that I have give my opinion about what I think about the British Prime Minister said about the success. I agree with the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill for these reasons: Failure in want pursuit your success do you make wrestler in the life, failure in want pursuit your success this one can do you make better in the life, and failure in want pursuit your success do you make more strong in pursuit your success. The first reason failure in want pursuit your success do you make wrestler in the life I think that because every day fight for want pursuit you success but many times' failure in things but continued fight every day. Also, I think that because if you afford every day you fight for pursuit your success and that do you make a wrestler in the life. The second reason is failure in want pursuit your success this one can do you make better in the life, I think that because when you commit one failure this teaches you to don't make that failure again. Also, I think that because when you failure that help you to want to overcome more every day and make better. The third reason is failure in want pursuit your success do you make more strong in pursuit your success I think that because the failure give you knowledge in the life and help to make the correct in the life. Also, I think that because when you failure that help you to overcome. I agree with the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill for all the reasons that can help you to pursuit you success though failure many times, but you can overcome all the failures if you don't loss the enthusiasm, all can be easier when you have enthusiasm and when you want continued forward with you life and pursuit your goals. Sincerely, ATT: Generic_Name.
