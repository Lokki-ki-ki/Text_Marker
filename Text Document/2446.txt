Dear, Mrs. Generic_Namely opinion is that I'm disagree with this policy of students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school. I don't think isn't good idea for students to commit to a career at young age. It has come to my attention that some societies, students are expected to identify a career by the time enter high school. Their courses of study in high school are selected to guide them toward a specific career and my position on this issue is properly to not makes that they aren't allowed to identify a career at a young age from selected to guide them toward a specific career because for all of those who has a career and is because there are worked hard to arrive from they are, and they get to propose.Currently, they can't have a commit to a career at young age, because for that has to be prepared and work hard nobody can have a commit to a career at young age. For that you need to finish high school and college and work for the career you want. Thanks for considering my opinion let me know if you have any question we can contact any assistance.
