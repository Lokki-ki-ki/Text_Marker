Do you think that having a positive attitude is the key towards success in life? In my opinion I do think it is key towards success, and the reasons why I think this is one finding a good career, second is meeting new people in a good way. In life, you need money to pay bills and in order to get money for your bills is to get career, a good one at least, and everyone knows that you need a resume, a good skill that you're going to work for, and a good/positive attitude to help you get the job. You people may wonder "why need to have a positive attitude to get your job?" well you want to impress and increase your rate of the person that is considering to hire you or not, also if start talking in a boring way the person might not hire you. The second reason is meeting people in a good way and never negatively. Meeting people in positive ways is very great thing to do meaning that if you treat someone like garbage they'll treat you some or even doing something terrible that will ruin your life, and nobody like that at all, so that's why you should treat people positive to avoid the things that I mention, or you just like treating people positive because that's your nature. I know how this world works and to survive the world of negativity is to be negative as well to survive this world, however that isn't the way to live and nobody likes to do negative things as well as they can't hold it for long time and end up taking away their own life, so staying positive is a great way to live in life. The conclusion I am trying to give at out is that being positive is the great way live instead of living in a way of negativity since being negative is way too tough to live out and positively gives you joy and give more paths to walk through and that's what I think a key to success means.
