Hello Ms or Mr teacher, I'm writing this for convince you to don't work in groups, and here are my cons and pros about working alone or in groups. The benefits of working with a group, or working alone are complete different because some people feel more comfortable working alone than working in groups. In my opinion working alone is much better than working in groups. In some cases your teammates of you group don't participate in the work, or they don't want to work in groups. I feel more comfortable working alone for many reasons. First reason, I can do whatever I want to do in the work or do the work in my way, but in some cases the person who work alone doesn't know how to do the work in this case is good to work in group because maybe your teammates knows the answers of the work. Second, If I work alone I have more chances to understand the work by my self without distractions. Because in some cases your teammates of your groups are distracted you or other teammates of the group. Third, working alone can be more benefit than working in groups because you can learn more things about the work, and do it in the way you like the work, without worry about what your group is doing. If we work alone we will have the opportunity of learn more about the work. I know working in groups are the easy way because maybe your teammates of you groups knows the answers of the work, and you don't have to worry about the work because you know your teammates will do the work for you. But in some cases people who don't participate in the work gets credits in the work what he or she doesn't participate it. And that isn't fair for you or your teammates who did the work. That's why you should considerate us to do not work in groups anymore.
