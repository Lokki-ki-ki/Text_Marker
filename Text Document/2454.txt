Some businesses have adopted a four-day work week with each day consisting of ten hours. To conserve energy and resources, my school should not follow this model by extending the school day two hours. Because everyone gets tired or esteemed, do not make enough money to buy resources, and don't have enough time to be with the family. The benefits to conserve energy is to sleep the eight hours. So you can conserve the energy and don't be extreme about be more time in school. In contrast, if you do not sleep well you feel like you will felt sleep. So is better fewer hours of school because everyone will conserve energy and the fewer hours of school can before better because everyone would be concentrated and learn more. Is hard to be in school and have a job after school. Because both of them are important for our life. But must people what need is money. So must people prefer to work and make money than have more hours of school. For this reason many people prefer to have money because can buy any resources or anything that they need. For example. If I am working and also going to school and the school day extend for two hours. I feel very extreme, so many people coot school. And prefer to work. There are also some disadvantages because if they extend the school day two hours is not in ought time to be together with the family. Everyone need time to have and be with the family because family is important. So for these reason my school should not fallow this model. If you spend more time in a job or in school there is not enough time for the family and also everyone need time to make the different responsibilities that have.
