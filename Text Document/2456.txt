This sentence is literary true, because you never to be idle, because you can do wonderful things, just need believe a little more on yourself, and always we need to think that sometimes we commit a mistake, and that's good because the mistakes is how we can learn about that nobody is perfect, no better if are wrong things or good things, always you learn that the life is not easy, but is not impossible, so don't be scary, the life is a game, and you decide if you want to be a winner or a loser. So you don't think that to be mistaken is wrong, but if you make a mistake, try to don't do it again. I give you an example: If you are on a game (football, soccer,basketball, etc), so if you are on any game and your time is lost, but you know the won in the other team, so you know that you can attack on this won, and you can win the game, or if you lose that game, but you got the revenge, well now you know where is the wrong and maybe your team won the game. So you can make a mistake, but no more than one time.
