Do you think older student should assist younger student? I agree I think it would be a fantastic idea. I think older student should assist the younger students I think they would get a lot of work done. The student would get along easily if they work together. I feel like older student would help the younger student improve there thinking by getting help from the older students. I feel like the younger student would not be afraid to ask the older students for help. It would help the class communicate to one another. The program would be a success because student helping one another is great seeing them work together as a class having a good time with their classmates. Also, the older student are more responsible there also likely to be more trustworthy. They would help the younger student a lot I feel like they would learn more. Then in a few years later the younger student would come the older student and from there they help them as well too. This program would be a great one it would there student a lot. I also think they would be focus all the time. I would also like to be in this program it seems like you would know so many things. Furthermore, I really think this program would be successful to all the student.
