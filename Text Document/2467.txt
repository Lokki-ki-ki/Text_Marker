Thomas Jefferson wrote, "Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing." I can not say this is a wrong opinion, but I have a different opinion with Thomas Jefferson. While other people might think that if you keep working hard, and there will be one day that you can get successful. Because you did not give up for these things, however this is a wrong way to thinking, the reason behind this is yes it is sure that if you are keep working and do not give up then you might be become a successful person, but It's still depended on what kind of ways are you choice to go. If you choose a wrong way to go then you get a big mistake, you have to start all over again, that's wasting time. Other reasons that behind people think they should keep working are it can let people have the spirit about do not give up and have brave to try something. But people will get lost when they're working too hard, they do not know what should to do, and if they failed about what they're doing now, they will be worried about next time when they want to do something, they became aired to try. So my suggest is people should be thinking before they want working hard, to make a plan or talk to someone and know what they think. Then you CNA get more easily to successful.
