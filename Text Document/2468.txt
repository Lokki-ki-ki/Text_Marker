It is my pleasure to take this great opportunity to express my view or opinion on the above topic; which is positive attitude is the key to success in life?. First and foremost I would like to briefly talk about the term attitude, it can be shorty defined as a good or bad conduct or manner one's shows in public or the kind of act you put up which is either good or bad. If we really take good look at how people live, attitude is the most relevant thing they mostly pay attention to, lets talk about work school. WORK OR SCHOOL:If we take good look at these two places, we can see or sort of attitudes aspects, either good or bad that is coming from the students, teachers and many more, showing good attitudes towards others shows how respect you are and what kind of family you came from, most people had a good relationship with others because of their good attitude they have acquired from school or at home, students with good attitude are more easily to associate themselves among others, and become very good friends, teachers really love students who always show a good attitude, sometimes too they can earn some gift from others. HOME OR CHURCH:This really take places in our various houses, showing good attitude to your parents, or it can anyone, mostly help to gain favors from people you might not even know they might be your futures helper, because there is a saying nobody knows tomorrow, for instance you went out and some random person ask if you can help him or her to find a place, but your attitude did not let him even to ask you anymore, but imagine some few years later came, and you met such same person that ask for your assistance, but your attitude was not good at all, maybe he is a manager at your dream job you have prayed to work there, so as soon as you get there you saw he is the one who is going to interview you do you think he will be willing to gave you such opportunity even though you qualified the answer is no he will find any means to let you not get that job, your bad attitude ruin up your whole life, this goes to church too, having positive attitude at church draws human being closer to God and attract more blessings from him as well. POSITIVE ATTITUDE AMONG INDIVIDUALS;Last but not the least is the kind of attitude we gave among ourselves, this has become a daily rampant that need to failure to get help from other people, imagine you had like 4 close friends, but they are being asking for your help on something but some of them attitude is very pathetic, but insisted they really need your help and what you have on you can only help few of them, so would you go ahead and help those who had a negative attitude the answer may be no, because you're going to help those of your friends whose had a good attitude first before you assist them too, this really tell us having positive attitude can really give you so many opportunities or advantages. THESE ARE SOME MERITS OF POSITIVE ATTITUDE:1. It creates good interpersonal relationship among individual.2. It easily to get favor from other people.3. Furthermore, it always brings peace among others.4. Furthermore, it really depicts the kind of family you came from or the type of trained you have acquired. THESE ARE SOME VITAL OR MAJOR REASON WHY WE SHOULD ALWAYS HAVE A POSITIVE ATTITUDE;1. Because it enables individuals to always have a good name in any places they found their selves in and, it also promotes economic living, because you individuals really knows good your attitude is so they will always be proud to share their issues or problems with you without been hesitated.2. It attracts blessings from God, because the bible is even against anyone who does not show a positive attitude among his or her neighbor, and can make your life been successful with the help of blessings you're getting from your creator. HOW POSITIVEATTITUDE HELP US IN OUR OWN LIVES;having positive attitude really help individuals a lot because this earth we live in everything is about attitude even assuming you apply for a job, and they monitor you for a while then later realized you had a bad attitude, do you think the person who is in charge of that work will be willing to hired you the answer is no, because no one can hire someone who has a negative attitude, so imagine now you had positive attitude everything is excellent you even feel proud of yourselves you do not even care wherever you might find yourself in because your attitude is perfect, and it can give you so many chances in life that you think you not even to have it, you can also become a remodel to some people, they might even look at you and learn from you, so is very good to have a positive attitude and move free wherever you go, some people really pay attention to people attitudes even more than everything in this word.CONCLUSION;Due to time factor I would like to bring my above ominous to an end and I am pretty sure it may be taking into consideration and publish it for other people to have access to read and if they had to make some changes in their lives they can surely do so to it.
