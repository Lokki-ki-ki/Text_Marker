I think What Thomas Jefferson wrote is a pretty good idea. But I also believe that some other people think different, some are agree and others are disagree. People will always give their own opinions about what the other people do. There are reasons why I think what Tomas Jefferson wrote is a pretty good idea. For example, if we work hard every day and we're always doing something that much may be done. Also, the person who wrote the testament was someone with classic and that make help to inspire some people to never give up. But some other people accomplish about doing something every day. Althought other people are thinking that inactivity serve a purpose, others are always doing something to be done as soon as they can. Because inactivity will bring you nothing wonderful to your life. In conclusion, I think we all need to think the same way as Thomas Jefferson to be success in our life's, without complaining and always doing something.
