For various reason's I think that students should have at least a B average to be able to participate in sports or other activities. The first reason is that a lot of student's maybe think that a C average it good. But, for many other students a B is a better average then, a C. Also, I think that it would be a better reason for the student's because a lot of student's want to participate in sports or other activities. So, then they could focus more in school and, get good average's. The second reason is that parents would also be happy for there children to have good grade's and, that they could participate in school activities. And, also they will be proud of there self's. So
