Dear principal, I would like you to change the policy to at least a b to get in sports because people would work harder for it and because you would have much more people passing school and getting healthier. It would get more people concerned on their grade and will ask for help to their teacher, or they would stay after school for tottering. People would do better in sports because they learned how to do it. And it would make the collages won't them even more. It also makes less people deal on their test or any exam because they would have studied allot more than they have before. People would want to work so hard to get in any sports they wonted and when the get that score that they wanted they would be happy of what they got
