Splash there I was drowning when the lifeguard saved me, but that was a long time ago. In that situation having the skill of swimming would've been good but at the time I was young. Everyone has a talent or a skill? Do you have a talent or skill that you have practice for or worked so hard for that skill? Well one of my strongest skills is swimming know not everyone can swim right well now I can unlike the time I was drowning well from that experience I have learned not to jump in the deep side of the pool. Well I can swim and an important talent to have or else you will probably end up like me, but swimming is one of my talents I love swimming and I'm good at it and I learned to swim by myself. Although talents and skills are nice to have but sometimes you just have to work for them like if you want a skill that requires a lot of effort then you have to prepare yourself. Practice and practice it makes perfect trust me that's why every one says it, because its true and that's why I'm such a strong swimmer. Every time that I went to a pool or river to have fun with my family I always tried swimming failed a lot but every time I fell I would force myself to get up and try once more. Takes a lot of work and money to be a good swimmer. In the summer I always begged my mom to go to the pool sometimes she took me and sometimes not but for the times that we went I put all my effort into it. Effort, effort is a big part of obtaining a skill. It all just depends on your part of the process. The process mite be long, or the process mite be short it all depends .in conclusion every one has a talent or skill. Skills and talents take time, practice, and effort, what talents and skills do you have and if you don't like the skills and talents that you already have learned another one it doesn't take much.
