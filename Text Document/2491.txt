First impressions are always the most important thing when you meet someone you want them to think good of you, so you do your best to make them feel comfortable around you. If you make a bad impression the first time with probably that person It is going to think that you are like that forever. There is no way you can change what others think even when you have not talked to them, people think what they want to think, and it is hard to change their thoughts. You can do a couple of thinks to make them trust you and change their perspective about you: like be kind, ask them about what they like, etc. Start a conversation that makes them feel they can talk with you about whatever they want, however sometimes things like that do not work, and simply you just can not change what other people think that is why you should try to make a good impression the time you talk with a new person that is the reason why first impressions are important.
