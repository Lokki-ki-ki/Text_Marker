Influencing other with positive qualities by expressing action or even he way how we talk, is the best and only way to represent your character. I strongly agree with Albert Schweitzer, a good example by your own behavior the best way to influence other people. Because it represents your positive qualities and as well as culture, and help others understand more about you. One reason that people should behave positively, is that they can represent themselves to others. As an example, people with positive behave draw others' attention by the way how they physically act and speak. They are easy to convince, open to everyone, and humble. In my real life experience, I have met a lot of this kind of people who I consider as friends now. I was influenced by them the first time we met, with their positive attitude and respect. Another reason why reason that people should behave positively, is that they can influence others by their culture. In my real life experience, I have who drew my attention by the way how they interact to others and I wanted to know and learn more about his culture and religion. In the final analysis, acting positively influence the surrounded people, helps to make meet and make new friends.
