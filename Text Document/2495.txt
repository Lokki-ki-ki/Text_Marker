Dear Teachers, Date: 03/12/19Address:Center St Generic_City In my opinion working in group should be more benefits. Teacher should let student work in group. Teacher should be allowed students to work in group. There are three reason why should they let student work in group:Working in group think stronger and faster. Each of all students can catch a mistake. It would benefit to get more information about what topic they will do it. Firstly, you can look more than one idea. Secondly, all students can make one question about what they are doing. Thirdly, if you work in group you can be more comfortable with your work. Your working should have the best idea and should not be any mistake because before to give the work to the teacher all students should look at it. It would be more interesting to meet another students and know what they can do it, and if you can help in something that they don't it. Also, in some schooler teacher let student work in group because some students don't feel comfortable to do the work by themselves. Some activities should be necessary to do in group. For example, when they are doing a project. However, most of the classes have work shit to do in group. For example, make experiment in a lab, present in front of the class. Some students say that work in group is more funny than being alone. Sometimes, teacher don't like to put student in group because they observe that when student are in group they just talk about another thing not about what they tell you, but not all the students like that. In conclusion, for these reasons is more benefits to work and group than work alone. Sincerely, Generic_Name
