In my experience I don't disagree, that Emerson thing that mastered will never get him grow. First reason, all people get mastered and that stop them to grow in something that they tried to do, For example if you are doing like your own job, and you are the manager you will see all the product that you are selling is going down, and you job it's not going well, of curse, you will be in unless to try to sell other product and your stored that will happen to you, and you stored that you will fell terrible, and you will you are not valuable to continue in you job because you are so eager to see that your job is going down not going up. Second reason, Mastered is like you are in favor of something and your friend fight to tell you that you are round with what are you trying to do, After your friend try to tell you that you was so round you undated that you was round, them you tried to do the thing right but, you are you get in mastered and that make you to not have other change to tried again, everyone is unless to try something that they already mastered and, something for example you are teenager, and you are is school, and you did a test, and you get bad scored of curse you feel so bad, and you will now tried to retake your test again that having mastered. Third reason, being scared to try again something that you love and that you think if you try again that will be a same way that you did the first time, but went you try again, you will have more experience because you will try to not get the same mistake that you got first time, and will have to look so careful to not get the same mistake because you have more experiences. We all can do the thing many times the thing is that you have to believe in you, and you will look that you will grow not matter how hart and, how many times you get upset, you have to be positive and to be screed if already have mastered. Conclusion, It's that you never give up at what are tried, not matter how many times or change you take you feel that you get in mastered you always will have other change to start and trust that you can believe that you can do it because that's all that you need to start again.
