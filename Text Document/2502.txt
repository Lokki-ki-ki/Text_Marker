I think is a great idea to identify your career during High School, Because it will help you to move on what you want to work on or who do you want to be on the future. First I think is a good thinking because during High School you can find a class that can be related about the job the want or the person you want to be. My second Though is that it will help you, and you will learn more about the job and have more experience that way when you get the job you will know what is about it and how it works. My third though is that it will make you progress before you get the job you will know what to do. My conclusion is that it's good to plan thinks during High School because that way people help you and teach you about the job or the person you want to be it will make you progress.
