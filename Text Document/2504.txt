We will not be benefice of taking classes online and the reasons can be for slow internet, get distracted and not having time. There is a bounce of students that have problems with slow internet, sometimes the internet doesn'tload the wed pages and with slow internet we can not do our online classes. One time I was with my friend in his home and he was taking his class online like every day and then the internet when down, and he did not finish his class online and the internet didn't work until the next day. Most of the time we get distracted at home, for reasons that are not even important at all like we want to eat, our parents need help, and they call us, and we need to use the restroom every time and those reasons can be a big issue for people who take classes online. When I was in LOCATION_NAME I took some classes online, it was my first class and my uncle did not know what I was doing classes online, and he calls me more than 3 times and because I was using my headphones and I did not ear when he calls me the 3 times he gets mad, he disconnects the computer and the computer shot down, I did not finish the class because of my uncle and the teacher tell me that I was so disrespectful to her, and she didn't want to give me classes again. One of the most common problems is the student don't have time for example we have jobs, and we don't have time for classes online. Some students are in club, or they go to church, they also take care of their little brothers, with these reasons is why taking classes at home is not a perfect idea. Do you really thing that taking classes online can benefit student? Issues can occur, when we are doing the classes online from problems of slow WI-FI and also problems or differences with family that may affect us in our concentration with the classes, that's why I don't agree of having classes online.
