I remember when I was in elementary school my teacher would always show me life lessons or lessons that would help me in life. I still follow the lessons she gave me. You guys as young kids, should follow these life lessons I will tell you. The first one is you when you're older do you want to have a good job have good money? You will always respect others, yourself and properties. It's really important to follow those lessons because when you're interviewing for a job or something like that you are going to use those rules and life skills and show that your responsible and care about your future. When your going out with your friends like heading to the movies you're going to show the workers respect and kindness. Kindness is another example of a lesson. That my family always taught me and others as well because they know others like it when you give them respect. When your older people are going to realize how respectful you are and mature you are.
