Our character sometimes develop by our own choices, and other times it develops by the influences in life, we can choose what kind of person we want to be either good or bad, some choose to be both you can't really pick a side and stay at it, there's good in every bad and there's bad in every good. Some choose to be bad because they think if they choose to be a good person people will take advantage of them since good people always the ones who care so much, help others all the time, and think about people happiness before theirs. They're wrong in my opinion because being a good person is better than being bad who are most likely the selfish ones that don't care about anyone except themselves. But in my opinion having a character isn't just about being a good or a bad person, it's about having a good personality, loving yourself and loving people, making others happy, having a positive energy, but also most importantly not forgetting about yourself. No one can really have a perfect character everyone got a dark side in them but only show it when needed, like if they were hurting or something bad happened to them or any other life reasons, that's if you choose your own character and choose to be good or bad. Sometimes you really can't choose your own character because the influences of life will choose it for you nothing will be in your control, it all depends on the life you were born in, like your culture, religion, and the people around you, but that's not all sometimes the way life goes is the reason your character change you can choose to be something and life's decisions will choose something else for you, life can be like a puzzle it never lets anyone stay as they are, they always change, grow up, be mature, or things that happens to them in life will make them grow up even if they're young or still not an adult yet. For me, I think age isn't the thing but a number, the thing that make you mature is your character and the way you think, if life didn't force you to have a specific character then choose your own character and make it different don't try to copy someone else and be life them, just be you, be different it's more beautiful.
