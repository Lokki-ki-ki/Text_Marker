I may not have experienced working before, but I will be very useful and responsible at work. For my first step to know better and experience about real world, which real world I meant after graduated from college and have real career, I need to learn and experience how to work at here. I could've got to an other place but as I am teenager, can not go to for long distance, so I choose here. One of the reason you should hire me, is I was in varsity swim team at school before, so I know how to team work with co-workers, and I could use team work for team for customer service also, like if I brought wrong order for a customer, I apologize first and bring right order with some extra customer service. Second, I always help my mom and do chores for her. Clean living room, kitchen, basement, bathroom, and other rooms. That helps me when customer is complaining about like a table is dirty, or floor is mess, I can go there quickly and clean them fast as I could and go back to my job. Also, my hobby is playing games. But I limited the time when to stop, so I do not over-play and control myself to keep playing and stay up till midnight. Also, I have lifeguarded certificate, so I know how to first aid a customer. For example, when a customer start choking, I can first aid and if that succeed, that customer will love this place come more often then usual. As conclusion, I never worked before, but I have all these skills and responsibilities, you should hire me to this place.
