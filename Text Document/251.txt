A great author, Ralph Waldo Emerson, once wrote, "Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow." Based on my experiences, I agree with Mr. Emerson. Because in order for a person to grow, that person will have to do a certen task, to help that person reach that goal or goals. There are difference things a person can grow in like: school, career, and hobbies. In school a person learned skills to help a person in the further such as, drifting, reading, vocabulary, history, and math etc. A person will learn, how to talk to other people, and how to act, by making friend. Also in school like, community collage, can help a person can also develop jobs skills, for further career. Another thing you can grow in, is careers. A person can grow in their career by going up their working rank I am currently working at Search, and I am the supervisor their. At first, I got hired as a cashier. It took me a while, but I got my way up there. Hobbies are another thing you can grow in. People can learn and practicing skills to help them up prove theirs hobbies. One of my many hobbies, is drawing. When I was six, I can only draw sticks finger. I have taken many art classes to help me develop my drawing skills. Now I can draw a human with details. Going above in beyond, what you have mastered can help you with, learning a new skill, going up the jobs rank, or developing a skill for a hobby.
