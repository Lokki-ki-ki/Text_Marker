I'm agree, so the student can basically learn more on this time, but if it is putting one hour and half more should give some type of food or snack for them, because on this time the student will be hungry and too tired to stay on school studding, but I'm agree with idea because a lot of parents or guardians go to work early and just come back tonight and cannot stay home for caring they children and this one and half hour it will be too much helpful for the parent/guardians and also teachers who like to teach. Will be helpful for the learning of the kids because all the hours on school is good for the learning, and you can learn more and more all days on school in this time, and when they put this one hour and half it will be good for all because also the family as the teacher like to see that person is learning something different that you teach them to do it. Getting perspective about the life, and will know that life is not that easy because it has they good this and they bad things happening all time around them. When they put more time for the school the student can enjoy what they want and what they like example:Sports, Math, Science, Technology, English, Arts, Library or chess club that is the examples what the student can choose, they whatever he wants for their fun on that time and this good time will open the mind of the kids. Because of this time they can like more school, and he can stay every day and also can choose what you like and what you want to do it for learning different things on school, is not too much time but they going to have a lot of fun and this open the eye of them, so they can see that school is not just boring for them, but you can also have a lot of fun. If i would give a suggestion or a compliment on this I just will say it about snack for the people who are staying more time than others, because it will provide that the student do not get weakness, sickness or heading, for some reason this can be affected if you do not eat something all day.
