Well I think we choose our own character traits, because its up to you what you want to do, we choose if we want to be happy, sad,or angry. I've learned that with my mom, she always tells me,"you choose to be happy, sad,angry"Sometimes our character is formed by influences beyond our control, and that's okay everyone has different reasons to be mad or to be sad, happy, but we can change it if we want to. The British naturalism and politician John Unlock was right about what he wrote, this helps a lot of people to understand that if someone does, did,say, or have said something to you, it'll be our choice to get mad, sad,or just ignore what happened. After that your character it'll be what you choose to make it. For example, i've been brought a lot this past years, my childhood was not the best I did not have a father or my mom when I was a little girl, i grew up with my grandparents my uncle raped me when I was seven years old, my other uncle he used to hit me all the time in my head, my grandma used to hit me with the belt, I was fat when I was a little girl, and people used to make fun of me, That really affect me, because I'm unsecure about my body, or how I look, i've in Hospitals because I try to kill myself last year, because I was depressed, because all the things that I've been brought and now I choose to be happy, im going to therapies on Monday's, i started working, I play soccer, or I go out with my sister. I have chosen to be happy. Sometimes it's hard to be happy, even that you know you want to be happy you just don't see one reason to be, and it's sad because you know your family it's feeling the same pain you feel inside you, the only thing you think in those moments are, "why would I do this" or "why am I trying so hard" . Those are the worst feelings, when you want to get up in the morning, but you can't. In conclusion, my opinion it's that everyone needs to know that, our character will be what we choose to make, we have to make good decisions to be good.
