Student should not find a career at a young age because they haven't chosen or think about what career they want to have many students think about what career they want at a young age but, it's better to find what career they want when they enter high school because student can talk to a counseling to see what they are interested in and can see what career is similar to what they like. A lot of student have troubling time to find what career they want to have many student careers doesn't end so well, once they enter high school student can find what career to have in the future, student can even visit a website to see what career are interesting for them or can visit careers search in school. If I have to choose a career at a young age I would not think of anything because I haven't found what career I'm interesting in also, it'll be better I enter high school and find what career I like and enjoy because thinking of what career I want would be hard at a young age also, I can talk to a teacher about career in high school, so they can help me of what career is available that are right for me and I don't think student should find a career at a young age it would be hard for them to find one. I have to disagree of student finding a career at a young age because if student do find a career at a young age then they won't be focusing in school work they mind will be them having that career by now and will brag about it to their friends and teacher no one want to hear that's also, it may not be the right career for them, they need time to think the right career they want to enjoy in life.
