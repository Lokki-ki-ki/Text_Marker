I disagree that first impressions are impossible to change because, at first they could be shy, there personality could change, and they can come off rude in the beginning. The first time ever meeting you they can just be shy because there getting to know you. That's how some people work. It happens a lot in the work area. When I first went to work for my first day I was really shy and didn't talk to anybody, but now that I've been working there for 3 months and I've gotten so much comfortable with everyone there. Once you have gotten to know the person there personality changes thought out your friendship. It makes you think who you probably met in the beginning. Sometimes they could just be lying to you just to see if you're a good friend or just to make them sound better about themselves. When you first meet someone they can for sure come off rude but then after you get to know them its like there another person. That's how I really am, I just come off as a really mean person. You could bump into someone and they probably get mad and start talking to you so rude. You'll never know they could become your best friend. In conclusion, a first impression is possible to change because they might come off shy at first, They could change thought out the friendship, and they could come off rude at first.
