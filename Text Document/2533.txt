I agree that first impressions are almost impossible to change. Because all the people are not easy to get a good impression, and also are not easy to change the mind. In my experience most the time when an impression come up to my self, it is impossible to change the mind, because if I don't like something my impression is very bad, but it is impossible to change my impression. Most the people do the same things I do, because we are people, and we almost have the same feelings. The first impression is always something has too much that we can talk. Most the time the first impression is hard to change is like a decision; when you took a decision is impossible to change, because is something the human have never goes down always up. This mean that the person when they have an impression about your car, picture, family, or friends they will never change the impression for them, but if the change should be impossible like a decision. Based on my experience the first impression is impossible to change, pretty much on the humans and the animals. Why I say on the animals, because long time ago, I had a dog this dog was very intelligent he does every thing I tell him, but sometimes he had some impression that was impossible to change. Always I give to him good food, but something a give food that him don't liked, and his impression was very bad, always was hard that him change his impression.
