Is it possible to impress someone at first time? Based on my experience I am extremely agreed with this statement. It's possible to impress someone based on what we are, what we are doing, and what we want from them to do, because now days which everyone is fully educated and knows what is wrong or right, believes on their own. We can impress people towards our religion, towards our government party, and towards out country to visit. We can impress people towards our religion by giving them the ideas of what is it about. How it will change up your future, how it will impact on your kids, how to treat with others, and also the idea of understanding someone better. Take them with us to the place where we practice our own religion, tell them the truth and advantages of it, and also show the religious cultures. We could impress people towards our government parties to support us by voting us. Promise them that we would not let them down, we will accept their wants and help them to advice it, we will make their education department strong that everyone can get education, and we will make sure that we provide them their dream jobs after they graduate college. We might impress someone to visit our country by telling them about the situation of our country, and tell them how cheap the things are. Show them the beautiful places, historical temples, culture, different kinds of foods, clothing, also about the rights of people. To conclude, impression is something that people do for others to get their attention for a specific thing, such as impressing people to convert to their religion, motivating people to vote for a specific government and choose a good leader for their country, and also impressing people towards their countries' situation to persuade them to visit their country.
