Dear. Principal,I think the best and awesome policy is policy number 1, because the students need their cell phones to call their family members to pick them up. I see a lot of students use there phones in class, but maybe if you give them other free times to use it they may not use it during class periods. Having to use phones in your own free time is not a bad idea, but need to remember to turned off their phones in class.From: STUDENT_NAME2/28/11
