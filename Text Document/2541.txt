We accomplish more if we are always doing something. I agree with that. People, who are always doing something will get a good habit. An active process creates a positive success, and in the road of the success, it would never have a footprint of lazy people. We'll create a good habit and accomplish more, if we are always actively focusing and doing something. With the good habit, we always feel good and comfortable to study, learn, and do everything. It'll make everything easier. Especially the way people look at you will be changed to positive and respect. Good habit also help you create a good process. An active process creates the positive success. Restaurant would not able to serve a delicious meal, if they didn't have a good preparation. We are the same. Nobody could be a good doctor, a good architecture, or anything good think, unless they tried hard and focused. So working hard, and always doing something is the key to open the successful gate. In the road of the success, it would never have a footprint of lazy people. We can't have a good result, if we'll be lazy, and inactivity doing, learning something. Nobody wants to hire or work with a lazy people, because they have none, they can't make a good result. We should not feel enough for something, that'll be a reason make us become lazy. So we should work hard every time, and we should not think:" Inactivity would serve a purpose". We should work hard to get and good process, and the good process'll create success. Never enough for something. In the road of the success, it would never have a footprint of lazy people. Thomas Jefferson wrote, "Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing.".
