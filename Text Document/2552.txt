Thomas Jefferson once wrote "determine never to be idle... it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing." I strongly agree with this quote for many reasons. If you're not doing something to help you get better, you're failing, doing something for a purpose makes you succeed in life, and inactivity does not serve a purpose to this quote. Although, others may think different and disagree with this quote, other people in this world needs this motivation. If you're not doing something to help you get better, you're failing. This role plays a huge part of others because failing is not a choice. You may fail a couple of times on this and that, but what are you doing to not fail again? If something isn't right and want to fix it, do something about it. In the other hand, doing something for a purpose makes you succeed in life. I play baseball for 10 years now and my goal is to make it to the big leagues but with this being my goal, I have to do something to help me achieve my goal. Success is not giving to you, you have to earn that success and by that, do something to help you succeed your dream. At the end, inactivity does not serve a role in this act. Inactivity is getting in the way of you not achieving and succeeding. I take inactivity as a negative act because I don't want to be sitting at home or anywhere not doing something to help me get better. Be the one who changes your life by doing what it takes to do something in life to reach your highest goals. Let this quote be an inspiration of achieving and succeeding in life or at anything. Be the one that can make a change. Doing something makes you accomplish more. It takes effort and hard work to do something but at the end, it all pays off. Only you can change yourself whether you want to be successful or not.
