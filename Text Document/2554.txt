Dear Generic_Name, I have always wanted an opportunity to visit and learn about the police force. I am very interested in crime and like to help people. At school, I am taking a criminology class. I would like to look for more opportunities to see what it's like to be a cop. Not only do I like to help people I like to solve things. I am interested in making this my job and I want to be able to understand everything that cops do. I want to be selected to explore new things and further my knowledge on how to be a good cop. In addition, I am capable of doing this, and I believe I can go far in this career. I will take this opportunity serious and I will let it teach me new things. I am open to knowing what it is really like out in the world. Having to solve things and really working your head to solve a case is what I find really interesting. If I could help anyone in any way I would and that is what cops do every day. I know that this will help me pursue a career in the police force. In conclusion, as the manager of the police force I hope that you can see that I am capable of doing this and will select me to visit. The like I have for solving things and helping others will help me as a cop. I strongly believe I can be a good cop when I get older. Having criminology class made me want to be a cop even more. I hope that you select me to learn and see what it's like to work in the police force.
