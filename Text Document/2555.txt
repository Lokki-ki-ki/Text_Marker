Students may say inactivity is the way to go, However other student say keeping yourself occupied will lead you towards achievement. But staying occupied is the way to go if you want to be successful and achieve things in life. Sitting around and doing nothing won't lead you to anything successful in life. If you're at home sitting around having nothing to do will not help you to be successful. If you try to find something productive to do it will help you in the future. To be productive or to do something productive really doesn't have to be school work related it can be anything like having a job, chores or helping around the community.Let's say you have homework but you don't feel like doing it, because you're used to not doing anything and or are lazy to do it. Which means you are more likely to procrastinate. On the other hand if you're used to doing your work the same day its assigned and or turn it in on time you are less likely to procrastinate because you are used to staying occupied and doing all your work. From my own experience, when I was 14-15 years old i wouldn't do anything at home or at school which caused me to do negative things that didn't lead me to achieve my goals at that moment. Now that I'm 17 years old I keep myself busy by doing school work or working my part-time job, which won't cause a negative effect on me because I'm preparing myself for my future and life goals. Overall students think that doing nothing is the way to go, but other students say that keeping themselves occupied leads them to a successful and positive life.Nowadays I can tell that teenagers that have been getting into legal trouble really don't have anything to do outside of school. While other teenagers actually do outdoor and indoor activity to keep themselves out of trouble.
