There are many kinds of enjoyable educational activities. Completing a science experiment is the most enjoyable activity. It's the most enjoyable activity because doing a science experiment teaches kids to have more responsibility on completing something. It teaches them to work hard together and have responsibility. My favorite thing about doing a science experiment is teamwork. I think that working together is important because it teaches kids to bond like family, talk to each other about it, and learn what mistake you made about it. Even if you don't make a mistake you still learn different things at the end, like bonding and learning how the experiment was supposed to be done. The activity is enjoyable because my friends and I get to do experiments together as a group. We assign a person to do a different task, so everyone can work. Our teacher tells us to clean up after ourselves for her next classroom, so she could get more organized. Doing a science experiment is helpful because people will start to like learning about science. This activity also makes you understand better as you are doing the experiment. These are the reasons why I think completing a science experiment is an enjoyable and educational activity.
