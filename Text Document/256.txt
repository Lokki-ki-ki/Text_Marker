Some societies may think that students are expected to identify a career by the time they reach high school. High school students shouldn't rush their selves to think about the career they want to accomplish. Most importantly they should stay focused on what's important which is education. Students have more than enough time to think about their careers, but not at this moment. They're too young to understand the reality that they're going to face, and the struggle that they're not expecting to happen. Which is why it's really important for them to stay focused on their education, then to suffer later in their lives. To be honest, nothing's wrong with thinking about your career, but it's not always healthy to think or stress about it all the time. Because it could cause an affection on your mind which isn't good. For students who first enter high school, should think more importantly about their grades and how well they're doing in school. At a young age students are fed in with so many ideas and careers that they want to accomplish in life. Their minds are too young to understand, so it's very important for mentors to help them realize that it's better to accomplish from education, than to suffer in the real world. For example, high school students who work after school, never find the time to come home and focus on completing their school activities. Because of their job that's holding them back. As a student, it's commonly stressing to go through these types of stuff. In fact, no high school student should have to go through these type of things. They have a whole life ahead of them and have the time to think about their goals. So, it's very important for students to focus on what's important, and not worry so much about what they want to achieve or accomplish in their career. The goal to everything is education, maybe some day when students accomplish their ways in education, they'll probably achieve the career that they've been looking for.
