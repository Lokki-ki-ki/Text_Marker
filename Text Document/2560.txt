Small acts of kindness has an impact because it can help you out, they can believe in you, and you guys can play sports with each other. It can help you out on your education and other things. For example, you went outside and saw an old man on a sidewalk, and you helped him walk across the road that's means you are showing him respect. I have a day when I saw a homeless man at a store and I had to give him 5 dollars because he was a nice man, plus he gave me respect. After that day I went to the store to see if he was still there, since he was so generous. When I was him I was shocked that what was he wearing. He has like a $10 dollar cloths on, and he told me how to get an education from his buddy that is rich. They can believe in you what you say. For example, you gave your mom respect and honor her a prize for being a careful mom, she will believe in you that you can do the SOL test excellently. People believe in you when you don't lie a lot. I lied to my dad once, and he still believed me buy when I lie twice, and he figures it out, I'll get a punishment. Some people don't care because they don't understand what are they talking about like sports or something. You guys can play sports with each other. For example, there was 2 people in a park, and they saw each other and both of there favorite color is blue, and they became best friends and played sports that they each liked. I have a friend when I didn't know before also he was very athletic, he was the same kind as me but I'm not really an athletic person. I talked to him and said hi, "he said" hi back so normally. Furthermore, I told him can I play, and he said sure and after that we became good friends. It can help you out, they can believe in you, and you guys can play sports with each other so that's why small acts of kindness has an impact.
