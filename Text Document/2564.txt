I agree with Churchill's statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success. I believe Churchill about what he said ''success consists of going from failure without loss of enthusiasm ''sometimes in life you have to be a failure to be successful. For example, I know friend of mind when he first came to the USA he didn't even try to speak English. After a while the time came, and he had to learn and try when he tried he filed and filed couples times in till he became a successful. Me in person filed couples times in all SOLS but I had fix and I kept trying and trying in till pass all of them. At the same time it might be a bad thing because some of us when they fail they give up so easy. I sagest we should teach student about what that success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.
