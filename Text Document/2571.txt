I agree with the plan of having an after school homework club. Because some students have a hard time finishing homework by themselves and if teachers stay with the students to help them finish their homework that would be amazing because that would mean less students failing. Also, some kids might not have computers or any electronic device in their houses. Although if there is no after school homework club that may be good because students can't get help from any teachers and that could be good because they can know that not everything in life is easy unless you are good at it or try your best and you're hardest. Another good reason that I think might be good for having after school homework clubs is that subnets get a chance to interact with other students, and they also get a chance to law or examine how the other students do their own homework. Some kids high take advantage of having after school homework club by cheating the answers off of somebody and then leaving. So I think if the after school homework club shouldn't let students look at each other's work until they are done. And some kids may take it as fun club and talk through the whole thing. But there is always the kids that do what they are supposed to do. They do not play around, joke around, and distract anyone from doing what they are supposed to do. So, at the end I think that there should be an after school homework club because there are more details to back it up then there is for backing up not having the after school homework program. And a lot of kids could change their work habit and not get as much as bad grades. And mostly kids who care about their grades would want to join, so there is high chance that kid do what they are supposed to do. But not having an after school homework program would mean that kids that really need to improve their grades would have a chance to do so and would have a chance to finish then grade they're in with good grades to start of for their next year.
