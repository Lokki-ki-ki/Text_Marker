Dear Mr Manager would like to work at Outback Stake House, and I just want to say your food is amazing, and I just want to work there because I'm really interested. And I know I will start low, but I want to bill my way up to the cook, and I was wondering if it would be OK to visit and take a look at the western and see where is everything like a meeting. And the time when I am available is Saturday, wends day, or Thursday if that's OK with you. My plane is to work there until I'm done with high school and after that I will go to college, but while I am working there I want to please the customers, so they can come back again, and I just want to work hard and get promoted. And the reason why I would like to work there is you pay good money and I just really like that western itself, and it would BR new for me. And ya that is why I would like to work there and what I would like to pursue there I hope they hire me. From, Generic_NameGeneric_Name
