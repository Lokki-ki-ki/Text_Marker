"I think that the principal have to considering allow student to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time. Because they have to call your parent when the school is end at 3:50".or if you have an emergency u can't call your parent.first than all, all kids like to have a phone but some of these kids use in the school to chat with other kids, and they don't listen to the class you can't not use the phone in class if they used the teacher can give him a detention. I think that are kids not use his phone in class. So I agree with the principal to allow student to bring to school y case of emergency if u need you can be used. So u can bring your phone and used when you finish the school. :)
