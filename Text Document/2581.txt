Business and schools should really consider the four-day work week because it would help conserve energy for them. Schools and business would be having ten hours of work to do each day for the four days they have. Students would have more time to do work and finish their assignments with the two extra hours of school. Students with low grades can get more help if it's needed for them. Teachers wouldn't have to stay after school if there are two more hours of school. Students would learn more with the time they have to show the students. Students would have an extra day of no school, so they can rest up. The students would have more time to be with there family. Students that have a job can go to work to make themselves the money they need. Students with big amounts of homework can catch up with that extra day, so all their work is completed. They would have time to do sports or something with the free time they have. Energy would be saved without and extra day. A lot of our natural resources don't stay forever, so we would have to help out by not using water, electricity etc. So much energy would be saved if there were a four days of school. Electricity cost a lot of money for a big building like a school to keep paying for.That's why schools should have school for four days to save the cost and energy that way the schools aren't left without energy in the future.
