I do agree with Emerson's statement, because I've had experiences where I did not know a thing but then I started to get better at it by practicing on what I wanted to get better at. There is this game that got really popular last year it was called Fortnite and everyone was playing it, so I decided to download it and play it because it was free. I was playing and did not know what I was doing I didn't know how to build or shoot or run I didn't even know where I was at, I started playing more often and got my first win with my friends, and then I started learning how to build and strategies to get kills, but I honestly didn't like it, so I stopped playing for a while and played different games that I liked more because this game seemed to childish for me to play. After a while my friends would tell me to play, so I would, but I got bored and played different games, then a new season came out on the game and I had money, so I bought it and after that everything changed. I really started to like it now because it had a good storyline, and it was more fun, I knew how to play, so I would just goof around then I really started to practice with my friends and decided to stop playing around we would fight one on one's to practice I would lose but I just kept going and going until I would get more kills now I've been playing for 7 seasons which is a very long time, seasons are usually 60 to 80 days in the game they aren't like seasons in real life like spring or summer their like TV shows how they have new seasons and stuff like that. Anyway I do agree Emerson's statement because on how much better at I got at the game and how long I've been playing and the experience I have in that game, I started out awful at it than started getting better and better the more I practiced and played. Not only me though I know people who started out around the same time I did which was in season two, and they were just as horrible as I was now it's season eight and some of them are even better than me. I also agree with Emerson's statement because I used to fail in math since I was a little kid than last year when I was in 10th grade I had a good math teacher who would help me a lot and after a lot of work and help that was the first time I passed math and also this year to have a teacher who do the same she helped me a lot and I passed that class too.
