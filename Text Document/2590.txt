I agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson to always keep trying to do best. My greatest accomplishment were to be student of the month in my school. I always try to be successful in my classes. Maybe best of the class but if you can try to can be one of then. Also you can make a goal for the year to get an A on your Geometry classes. I always try to compete with my friends who can get the best note on my exam. My cousin is the only one that gets the best grade at home. She studies lots and always gets very good grade. I admire her because English is not her first language and her mom is so proud of her. One day I want to be like her so can my family feels proud of me. The greats thing that I want to be graduate for that I have to pass my class and exams. For that I have to pass my others SOL and others elective classes that I have this year. The most difficult class that I have next semester will be Earth science, but I will pass that class and the SOL and I feel like I can do it.Finally, these are reasons why I am agree Ralph Waldo on constantly try to make you greatest accomplishment on his life. I want to do the same in my life too. These is some reasons why I was agreed. Always Try and never give up that you always can do greatest accomplishments on your life you only have tried hard, and you will success.
