People think that first impressions are almost impossible to change. I disagree with that because impressions is just what you think, always make you think different things, and you never know what's going to happen. Impressions are like when you thought something's, It's just what you think about someone or something. For example:My impression is that she is not telling me the truth. You think that she's not telling you the truth, but you don't know the truth. Impressions can make you think different or bad just because how you look at someone or something. For example: If you see someone that has a bad looking, your impression is that he might be poor but, you can change your impression if you see that he has the iPhone of the year, or he has a Lamborghini, so it can make you think different. When women get pregnant they always get impress and trying to guess what the baby is going to be. For example: When my mom got pregnant, and she had me, her impression was that it was going to be a girl, and she wanted a girl, but here I am, 18 years old, a big boy, and she was impress and sad, but when she sees that I was very handsome her impression change she's happy now. Some people believe that just with their impression you are what they say. Next time you think that the first impression is impossible to change, you have to think the first impression does not say everything about a person or something. I hope you never impress by something or someone, that can be different that you thought, that's why we don't judge, God is the only one who can judge.
