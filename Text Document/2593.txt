I agree to this became students like us always have to got to school everyday of the week and sometimes students get stressed out because everyday we have to got to school, so it should be better if they extend the school time to shorter time or half way. In my opinion it link that 3:15 is too much of our day so I think that we should make the school time shorter. I think it will be the best thing for everybody because sometimes people have to do thing at home. Sometime is just too late to do them because at 3:15 is already getting dark so I think it should be best for all of us if we should get out half-time. It will better everyone because everyone will have time to anything that they have to do at home. The last thing I see is that other schools get to get out more early that us and what I think is that is mot fair they come out early and we don't. But sometime we should have more time out of school because when I go home I have things to do.
