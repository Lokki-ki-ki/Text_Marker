Generic_NamePrompt-My prompt is explain to people why seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choiceSeeking multiple opinions is a better choice because you can get a bunch of different opinions and they most like will have a better point of view. It's better to have multiple choice then just having one choice or opinions now for some examples Example one If a student is having issue at home they have multiple opinions which are 1. Talk to a counter 2. Talk to the school social worker 3. Talk to a trusted adult 4. Talk to a friends parent 5. Talk to other family members.example two a lady haves a few job offers, but he goes for one and thinks he's not going to pass the interview but he still has a few jobs lining up behind him the job offers are1. Sceintest at NASA 2. Host on the Ellen show 3. A business owner. I also feel like asking one person would not be the best choice because what if they don't have the best opinions or best advice, i feel like for the BST advice ask more than one person make sure the person is trustable to make sure the person knows what they are talking about. To make sure this trusted person know what they are talking about ask them a few questions IIF they answer them right then they might be a person you can trust you the one taking to the kid or adult going having issues have patience with them its probably a hard topic for them
