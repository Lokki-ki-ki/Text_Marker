First, for example some people prefer working in group because they would get extra help. The other person in the group becomes with a new idea. I think working in group it is fun because each person in the group would l help. That why I prefer working in group than alone because the percentage of working alone is I can not get help from anyone. Also, I can not finish it early it would take long. Second, for example If I work in group we would discuss first and then be an agreement. Then start working each person in group would have to answer and with different answer. If anyone in the group does not know the answer the group would help him or her. It is easy and fast to finish any class work if it is in group. Working in group it is fun because each person learn from another idea of the other person. Third, working by yourself it is kinda hard. Some people prefer working by themselves because they think it's better. Working alone is more stressful. That why people should work in group. It helps, and it is better and less use of their mind. Fourth, for example if I do a classwork by myself, and it is hard. It would take me more time to do the researches in google. Also, I would finish it late. That why I prefer working in group than alone. Fifth, finally I would like to recommend to each student to work in group unless they are smart enough to do it by themselves. However, some students or people like to work alone if they smart then probably they would finish it on time. Teacher should be agreed with me. When students work in group it is less stressful because they can he leach other. Therefore, students or people should work together because it is less stressful, and would benefit a lot.
