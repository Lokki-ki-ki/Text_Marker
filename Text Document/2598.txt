Something I would like to accomplish is being able to stop being so indecisive and to make the right choice on time, this is important because this skill would help me be fast on things I like to do, such as writing or trading items. Main reason why I would like to accomplish being decisive, is because it effects the way I think, for example; ''What if I'm writing this essay, and I include some other thing that doesn't have to do anything with the prompt I'm meant to be writing about?" Then, I erase everything and start again, I sit for more than 20 minutes and end up with the worst decision. I would like to accomplish being able to choose my best decisions fast enough, that I don't have to worry about it. I have been working on this for a long time now, and it's not easy, I ask myself if it's this possible. Being able to decide for myself is important to me because I won't have to be asking people around me such as parents, teachers, or classmates to tell me if anything I do is good enough, and I'm always asking for opinions, ending up regretting for what I chose, In the classroom is hard to concentrate on the assignments and tests because I will have tons of questions going around my head, when ever I can't decide for myself I end up this concentrating and start to think about lots of different things. In conclusion, Indecisive is a big problem and something I would like to accomplish by time goes on, and something I can do to change this is practice to stay with one answer and not change anything that comes to my mind first, but it takes practice.
