Do you want your kid to be assisted by an older student? Well look no further, this program could make your child be smarter, prepare the young student for what's coming in the future, and an older student can help the younger student with his/or her homework. The older student that is assisting the younger student could make him smarter. What I mean by this is that the older student will help the student on math, language arts, and science which the older student already took. The older kid already knows the concepts of the subjects that the younger student is taking, which means he will teach him the concepts. This means that the younger student would already know the concepts of the three subjects that the older student taught him which is science, language arts, and math. The older student can prepare the younger student for the future. The older student can teach what he is learning to the younger student. For example, the older student can teach the concepts of algebra which the younger student is taking next year. The young student might even study algebra with the older student. The older student can teach other subjects like physical science, and civics economics which the young student could be ready for. The final reason why this program is helpful is that the older student helps the younger student with his homework. The younger student might ask for help on his homework and the older student will help him. If the student does not understand the question then the older student would teach him. This program is actually pretty good for your child if he does not understand and need help on a subject that he has trouble on. This program can make your child be smarter, be prepared for what's coming in the future, and an older student can help the younger student with his/or her homework. This is why the program is helpful.
