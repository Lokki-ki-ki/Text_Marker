We choose our own character traits because we can choose if something affect ourselves for three reasons:First, if something it doesn't matter for you, it will don't affect you. Some people when lose something material, and they don't care the material things, they're looking for a solution, Second,if you get a problem in your workplace, you would like to resolve the problem. Some people when have a problem in her workplace want to resolve the problem because they are passiveThird, if you discuss something to someone and the person is losing the control of annoyance, you won't respond back because you don't want more problems. Some people when someone is losing the control of her annoyance and want to fight, they don't do anything because they are passive. However, I know sometimes it is difficult something it doesn't affect ourselves because sometimes it relates to family, or something is really matter for us. In conclusion, we choose our own character traits because we can choose if something affect ourselves.
