People should'n need an expert for their life important matters, they should'n be trusting other people you can create your own ideas, you never know at the end of the day how things can result you may need an expert you may not. In my opinion having an expert for your life matters is not the best idea, but for people that are old they may need a life important matter because they need other people to help then with their stuff, people should'n be trusting other people with their benefits or life matters. You may not know the person you never know how big of a deal can be at the end of the day they can take everything from you, or they can be stilling your stuff without you knowing, I would rather manage my own life then being attached to somebody else. Being able to manage your own life make it easier for yourself, you can make your own ideas and decisions without anyone's consentiment, and you can achieve everything by doing it. Having an expert for your life matters is not necessary for your life is just a waste of money by hiring or having one, you can depend from yourself or your family if you ever struggle on life. Because people from those companies may treat you well and comfortable, but you never know with what intentions they're doing it. Not having a lifemattercan complicate your lifestyle in some ways, your health is not secure you need to pay a lot of money for the hospitals but it also helps you how to live your life and teach you how to manage your own cuisines and decisions, you can only depend on your self everybody should know their instincts; they should'n be scared to manage their own life at their own risk, you need to challenge your self of how live life with your own decisions. In conclusion people should'n have life matters experts because, at the end of the day you never know how life can change you, so you need to live your life with your owns decisions and your own instincts, you need to create your ideas and achieve then with your consentiment and your own risk you need to be yourself with yourself and take care of your lifestyle and your own cuisines.
