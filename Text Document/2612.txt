Dear Principal, I'm against for having a grade B average or up because a lot of students wants to play some sports too. There's a lot of great students who's perfect at sports and some other activities, but has bad grades. Many students can improve their grades, a C is a good grade so why can't they play. Playing sports can help make some students want to make their go up. If grades from A, B,C could their will be a lot of students playing and having fun, so if only students with grade B average could play there won't a lot, less than with students with grade C average to play, and by the way not everyone likes playing sports so everybody with a C or up could play maybe the team could be full. This is my reason about that students with grades C average or up could play.
