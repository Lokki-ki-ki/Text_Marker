I agree all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity at school, because it's good for them, and they can spend more they're time at school playing sport or doing some other activity like math club or working on the school yearbook any other clumping or activity, and help student learn more new stuff. Students could learn more about sports a be Heather and know how to play it other thing is that they can do there homework at school if they can't do it at home or if they have no one at the house to help them. Participate at schools activity something that all school should have and make students have a better gustation in there Fuchs and help how to become good person later in life. The most important thing about participate to school activity is you can spend time with your friend and teacher and your principal too, and it helps students with their grades too. Not all students have or must participate to school activity, but is there chose rather they want to or not but i think is impotent to participate an activity at school is for there good.
