Dear Barcelona FC, Im a student from the school, Generic_School, I would like to play and work for a professional football/soccer league and team. It has been my dream to be a professional soccer player for your club, Barcelona FC, for my entire childhood. Watching your players play on live television has always caught my interest every match they play. Ever since then, I kept pursuing to be a pro for your club. I would like to know what risk and what kind of pressure your players take and most importantly, what motivates them, what keeps them active and ready during matches. If you have the chance, I would like to make a request to visit your campus and department. I would like to know the works of every player's routine, how they train and how much effort they put into their work. I would like to interview some of your players and ask them questions about their life being in your club, how they got into joining, and get a better understanding of this establishment and get to know the players a bit better in person. better than any fan or article would know. I would like to know the history of this club, when it was created, the changes that have been made since and the salary of the players. I would like to know the rewards that this club as won;how many international league has this club been in and what has the club been thrown the most. This club has expanded over the world and I want to know the marketing of this company make daily and per year.
