"Technology can be Positive or Negative". Positive: Everyone knows that the technology can be like a friend for the people how like use all day like example, communicating with friends or families who live far away. But the technology permitted the people use like a tool like find books, or shop things which you can find in a mall or places where you like to go. In others words technology has an impact in the society, examples, help people to find jobs without need to go out and walk in the streets for a job or students need go a college and ask for information or when a people need to shop things without that the person need to go far away. Something technology have an advantage when you have problems with you live everyone always looking for games which help to clear you mind or when have problems with buildings of your home. Negative:In others words the technology always like show the good face but no one talk about the second face which can be a weapon for yourself or people who live around you. Because when you find a page where you look everything good like safe, but you never now who create this page or for what him create that. In many occasion the people use technology for things bad like examples, groups terrorist which use technology with an idea to be close with adolescence for invited to be in the groups of terrorist and something that pass with adolescence which have fathers that don't care what yours children make. In others occasion the technology is like a tool, because people like use a lot of time for Facebook o buy something in that, but l we know some people use that like a weapon like use for sale fake things and take the money from people who think they are stupid. We now technology has two faces positive o negative, but that depends on which always you find when you like use technology
