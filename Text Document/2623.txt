This prompt is about some people that need help to make their own decisions or need someone to told what they need to do even in their personal life. The question say" should people make their OMN decisions, or should they seek guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matters?" some people they will say that is better if someone as came and make there decisions in everything so, they don't need to worry about anything. There are another person that think that is way too much because how someone that they don't know is going to make their decisions and also the divisions of their life. This is a big topical because like I said before so many people can disagree with this, but there are other that are agreed with this, in my opinion I'm disagree with this because is my life and I need to laird how to deal with it. Even if my life is the worse one I'm going to take care of all my decisions sometimes we can ask at someone for an opinion maybe, because the person is more older than me but is only an opinion you're not having authorities at all at the person to go and make your decisions and then take care of all your stuff. In my conclusion is better if you take care of your on stuff doesn't matter how hard that it, is your life, and you are the only one that knows how to deal with everything that you have done so, this is my last decision people should make their own decisions.
