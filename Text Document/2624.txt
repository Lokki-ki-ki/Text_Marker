Yes. I agree with Ralph Waldo statement because it is true you got to farther than what you already know if u want to succeed in life you got to go farther than what you feel capable of doing live for example: I have a friend who plays soccer he used to stay playing defense I was like to Generic_Name u should try out on playing forward, he was like I don't know I have never played forward only defense, so I was like life is not about staying in one place life is all about going out there and do things you feel like you can't because u can't stay in one place for the rest of your life; and know he's one of the best forward players my school have, life is not about just doing things u can life is all about experimenting new things to do something out of your limits to see what else are you good at because it's a good feeling when you find out of what you capable of. When you go out of your limits, you can find out a lot of things about your self you get to know who the real you are, you get to know how intelligent, how brilliant you are to do things out of your ruin of every day we only live life ones, but we live every day without knowing if we're going to wake up the next day, on my opinion I do agree with Ralph Waldo on his statement.
