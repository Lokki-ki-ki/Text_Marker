If you're afraid that you're going to hurt someone's feelings by telling the truth don't be afraid to tell that person the truth. Being honest can lead you to many benefits and help you in many ways right now and in the future too. When being honest, people will start trusting you with a lot of things. But you've go tot be careful with what you do or say. You can get a lot of good benefits in life. A benefit of telling the truth all the time is building new friendships and meeting new people. On the other hand, people will have that mindset thinking that being honest is a bad thing. As you start lying more often, it can become a bad habit which you might regret later in life. Now if there's a case where you're trying to tell the truth, those same people that you have been lying too won't believe you. A negative effect that can ruin you is like losing friendships or losing a job based on the way you've been acting. Also, being dishonest can make people think that they can't trust you. Those people that you're lying too might think you're a bad person. You can show integrity to lots of people which can be by listening to them and telling them the good and the bad. Think of yourself like a role model to other people and having a positive mindset. If you show integrity, people will start looking up to you. Also, have a good explanation to the reason why you're lying to that person, well that's if they find out one day. Besides, if you had a good reason for lying that other person might forgive you. But let me tell you this as a tip, so you won't make a mistake and regret it "think before you speak", if you don't do that it can lead you to many consequences.
