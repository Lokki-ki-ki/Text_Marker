For the pass few years students have been using cellphones more often than the last 15 years; is when cellphone just started to be an essential apart from our daily life and during that time cellphones were not allowed using in the classroom, but times have change and now students are allowed to use their cellphones in the classroom. In this essay I want to answer a question "What are the effects of allowing students to have and use cellphones in the classrooms?". When cellphones were allowed to use in the classroom at first there were a lot of benefits for example: it became easier for teachers and students to do their work, for students it became easier to find information about a topic by using their cellphones instead of using a computer because sometimes there is not enough computers for every student, for teacher by allowing students to use cellphones in the classroom the teachers they could find better ways to do a class work by using an app that it might not be possible to use in a computer, but obviously nothing can be that perfect by allowing students to use their cellphone in the classroom there was a downside many students started to irresponsibly using their cellphones in the classroom. For example using a cellphone when the teacher is explaining a subject, using your cellphone to distracted others during the class period, etc. Does were some examples of the good and bad effects of allowing students to use their cellphones in the classroom.
