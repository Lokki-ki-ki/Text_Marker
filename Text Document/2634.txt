I recently learned that some educators feel like the summer break is too long and that the students do not retain information as easily when they return to fall some people argue that there should be year-round schools. Where there would be 3-4 week break in the summer a longer winter break and a week off in the spring and fall. In my opinion summer vacation should remain longer. I truly believe that a longer summer vacation can be beneficial for those students that want to work and save money when winter comes. One reason why summer vacation should be remained long is that when school ends some students choose to work on summer vacation to save as much money as they can, so they can stay in their house when winter comes. If they have only 3-4 week of break they will not be able to save money when winter comes. Having to work during winter is difficult for those students that do not like winter. In instance when I started to work I did not like to work in winter days. In my country the weather it is hot, and I am adapted to my country's weather not to cold weather. Another reason is that when winter comes, and it sometimes snows the roads are too slippery some students drive during the snow days if they work during winter season they might have an accident due to the weather. If they work during the summer they will not have to work during winter days. However, some students will argue that is better a shorter summer break than a longer break, a longer summer break can be helpful to do a lot of things such as, work or relax. Thank you for considering my opinion on this matter if you have any questions let me know, and I will be happy to talk about this matter. Sencerely, Generic_Name
