Positive attitude is the key to success in life. I agree having a positive attitude is always going to give you better outcomes. Having a negative attitude is difficult to be happy with life. In my opinion I think everybody is different. Always going to give you better outcomes if you have a positive attitude. Positive attitude is not the key to success in life because some people still have mistakes. Many persons positive and negative attitudes all depends on the difference on there personality. I agree having a positive attitude is the key to success in life, if negative attitudes didn't have a difficult time being happy. I disagree that negative attitude is always hard to be happy with life because sometimes good miracles happen. If there were more successful people in the world everybody would be a positive altitude. Most of the people are mixtures of both attitudes. The attitudes affect peoples life so much on which altitude they have. In conclusion having a positive attitude brings a lot of success in life so, I think more people should have positive vibes. A person who has a negative attitude won't ever enjoy life at its fullest. I agree having a positive attitude is always going to give you better outcomes. Having a negative attitude is difficult to be happy with life.
