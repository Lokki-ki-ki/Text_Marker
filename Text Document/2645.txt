My sister decided to be a doctor at a young age and started to focus on that path. Now, she is a doctor. Choosing which path should be taken in an early age and preparing for it beforehand, will help a lot for the future. Although some people might argue students should commit to a career later in their life, students should commit to a career at a young age because it helps them to decide for their future early, it makes them focus on a specific goal, and they won't feel more pressured to choose a career later in their life. To begin critics say that choosing their occupation later in their life is more beneficial because they will be open to more new options later than in a young age. To support this idea, a child decided to be an engineer when s/he was young, but suddenly s/he changed his mind and decided to be a surgeon. Should s/he choose what s/he wants to be now or should s/he choose what s/he wanted to be when s/he was young? However, it is obvious that choosing a career later in their life will only make them feel burdensome, and their life will only be more indicating. A more valid argument is that choosing a path to be taken at a young age will let you have a better life in the future. For example, a girl started to prepare for the career she had chosen when she was young and started to work hard for that. Finally, her hard work paid off and achieved what she wanted to be. This evidence is valid because preparing for the career in a young will let your life go smoothly, will give more free time in the future, and won't feel pressurized. Although people might say that students committing towards your career and choosing it at a young age will lead you to a better life because it makes them to focus on a certain goal of their life, will make them decide what they want for the future, and won't feel pressurized to choose their career. People should consider deciding their path in a young age for their own benefit and betterment.
