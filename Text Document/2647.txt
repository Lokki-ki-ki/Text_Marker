High SchoolRegular high school is 4 years 9,10,11,12 grade for graduate. But students can graduate and 3 years some school has a program that allow high school to graduate in three years, this programs has three option for graduate in three years. The first option is summer school the second option is evenings school and the last option is do not take any elective courses. My first reason, why I think is better finish high school in three years for students is because all the students high school are teenager, and they need time for do stuff. So why I think is good idea finish high school in three years is because they could be taken drive licenses, insurance, all stuff they need. My second reason, is because all the students are teenager, and some working for save money for college. If they can finish high school and three years they can work one year and same money for collage. My third reason is because all the students who follow these programs could be more option for find a good college, and find a good place for live close of the family and find a good job.conclusion. I think these programs are good option for students who want going to college.
