Is it a good idea for students to finish high school in three years and enter college or the work force one year early? School districts programs would be making a big mistake on allowing high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional 4 years. If they allow high school students to graduate in three years, they would be making everything harder in the Generic_School because students would have to put more effort than ever on passing their classes and the SOL. In any other state would agree on graduating from high school students in 3 years because their rules are different from the state of Virginia, For example, in Virginia high school students are required to have their SOL passed with more than 400 points, and the 22 Credits instead of graduating from for high school. Other states like Kentucky or Chicago will agree to this because they are required to have 22 credits for their graduation, and it would not be that hard to get 22 credits in 3 years. It would be a bad idea to allow students to graduate in 3 years instead of 4 because students would not like to come back to school in summer to do more work, get the credits they need, and make the SOL, as a student I would not like that to happen because we would not get a lot of time for vacations in summer to spend with my family, and I would not like to take courses during the evening, it would be like to be doing a lot of extra work. People in different states would like to allow this new rule of graduating from high school students in 3 years because they can prepare them more everyday doing their work, so they can graduate faster in 3 years. Many other people are saying that it would be better for them to graduate high school students in 4 years because students would be having a lot more of time to get prepare for college and for try to pass whatever they need for graduation. Students also would like to spend more time in the vacations with their family and not in the school having that pressure that you have to pass all yours classes and exams for graduation.
