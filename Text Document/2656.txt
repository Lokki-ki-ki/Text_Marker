Someone will find many activities enjoyable such as soccer. I think people should play many sport like soccerPeople will find soccer fun because you get to work together, and they just have fun. For example people now in days don't even talk any more they text. If you play together you can communicate with others. Working together with other people would be good for the future because you will know how to get along with others even if you kinda don't like them you will learn how to be patient. When you play soccer you get to hang out with your friends and possibly meet new people that you might actually might like. So you get to make new friends by just playing soccer. In life, it's not about winning it's about having fun with your friends. Mostly playing soccer can be fun other people you might not even know, so you get to work as a team and having more than one person play with you. If you go outside to play soccer you get to run and that's good for your health, so you get to have fun and be healthy instead of sitting at home getting sick by eating unhealthy. You can grow up to be strong, healthy,nice, athletic,etc... Soccer is a very fun sport that almost everyone loves some people don't really like it that's why I am writing this to pursued people to play. This is why I think people are going to enjoy playing soccer and talk to their friends saying that soccer is enjoyable.
