Dear principal today I would like to write about the plans that the school have with lunch food, I have heard form many students about the school food lunch changing many students are disappointed and others are happy for the news, My self personally I have my on opinion that I would love to share with you about this topic. In my opinion I think it would be great for the health of the school and student to have a healthy food during school hours, one main reason is because it keep our body, healthy strong in which we can reflex our education, It will benefit all the students mainly the ones that are in PE class, eating healthy can improves more day of life and better human body, eating healthy can prevent you from disease and probably some virus. By eating healthy you will not only will be able to be on a good fit you can also feel good and with feeling good about your self means more Thant anything in this world, my opinion about this I agree with this change and I would like to see more plans for the upcoming future years. Every play have good and bad opinions many students at school have said and have their own opinion, Many of them don't like to eat healthy they just what to eat and enjoy their life at the fullest, which is reasonable and i understand they point, we all know that the food that make our body get fat and get worse is the bad type food, but we all love that kind of food, is delicious, and it tastes great for example pizza, hamburgers and all those kind of food. To keep a balance and for the students to be better and feel better about them self I think it will be the best to have a schedule of food for example :Monday healthy food, Tuesday bad food... In my opinion i this it will be the best for our students and for everyone in the school to have a healthy food schedule that way we can be happy and satisfy with our body. I agree with the plan of replacing the school food for a healthy kind of food. Thanks for all your nation and I hope you like my opinions, and you could consider this on your future plans.
