Generic_Somewhere I would like to visit3/21/18If I had to choose a place to visit I would choose Brazil. I would go to Brazil to learn and expertise many new things. I could learn how to speak Portuguese, I can find out how Brazilian food is or I could even learn how to make it. Furthermore, I would even go and see one of the famous parades held in Brazil, one of my friends went to Brazil to see the parade, and he said "It was beautiful." Going to Brazil would be great. I would like to learn Portuguese because I could get along with the people and even be friends with them. I could even ask for directions if i didn't know where I was going. I would like to try out Brazilian food. Furthermore, I would want to try it because I never had it. It would want to know how it tastes and if I like it, I would try to learn how to make some of their foods. I would try to make it because I could make it at home and never forget about my experience with Brazilian food. I would like to go and see the Fantastic Parade in Brazil. Furthermore, I would see it and take many pictures and never forget about it. Furthermore, I would like to know how it feels to watch a parade that everybody loves. If I go and do all of this I would never forget about it. I would always remember the good times I had in Brazil. I never forget about the expertise I had.
