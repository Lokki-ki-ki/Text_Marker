I am going to talk about a prompt that Tomas Jefferson wrote, about being idle or always doing something;Idle or active?, I think that when you are active you can make and accomplish the duties that you have faster and better. The reason that I think being active is better, Is because you will get accustomed to always do something and that can help you in your future in your homework, house duties, and in your future job; and I know that being idle does not help you to grow as someone that is uses full to the society, because one of my cousins does absolutely nothing, and he starts to get into a lot of problems with our family. If you are always active you are showing to the people that you are someone they can count on, someone that demonstrate, values like determination, and responsibility; and most of the time people are looking for does type of people to manage a work place, food store, school,and companies. I also think that active people are more likely to be successful, I am sure that it is true because my father star to work when he was only 9 years old, and he was always doing something, and then with the time he reaches to be his own boss doing what he is like but never stop doing the duties that he give to himself make him a really responsible person; and that why I think that person how are always active have more potential to succeed. The reason that idle people are not going to get anywhere for me is because most of the time people are looking for somebody with energy and wants of work and if you are one of the people how are always on the sofa watching television I am sure that you won't be the first choices for them. In conclusion the reason why I chose the people that are active make more accomplishment in they daily life is because that have more opportunities to show to the word that they are here and that they want to be seen, and they want something to do and do it better and that they can reach their goals.
