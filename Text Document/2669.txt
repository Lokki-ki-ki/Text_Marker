No they shouldn't add an hour more because we don't need the hour, but they should completely change the time for waking up and getting ready to come to school at 8 because I feel like every kid will have energy and not fall asleep. Also I think they should put each class an hour like example math should be an hour also Science, English, geography because all we honestly do need is come to school get our education then go home we don't need all stuff they put like electives they just make the day longer and waste of our time honestly that's my opinion and how I see it. They should only put the one-hour in for the kids that need help or catch up with there missing work and that will help more for them because it would benefit them more but after all the day I think they shouldn't put that extra hour but like I said only if kids need help they should put the extra hour in. After all they shouldn't make it an hour because It's really not worth it if we already have a long day of school they should just take electives away, so school can go faster and just get it over it also just get our education faster.
