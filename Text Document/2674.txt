I think students should commit to career at young age because of these reasons. Students should commit to a career at a young age because it may have them in school because students may be thinking about there future and then get motivated to get more done. Students at young age also be invested in the career they may choose for example being a soccer player, being a basketball player, being a football player etc. This is the first reason why students should commit to a career at a young age because it will help them become a better person in life and also help there future. Students should also commit to a career because it will help them prepare for life because they will be getting for college and that's a big step from high school that is there road to success because when they are in college they will be leading about there future job whiles if students who don't think about there future at a young age will probably go down hill for them something like getting into drugs or getting killed this is a second reason why students should commit to a career at a young age. Students should commit to a career so that can can have a good life because if you don't think of a career at a young age you will not be good in life there many examples like being homeless. Therefore, students should start thinking about a career because it would be coming so fast. These the reasons why students should commit to a career at a young age for a better future.
