Taking out the student favorite food shouldn't be taking out cause a lot of kids won't even come to school cause of the lunch and if their different kinda food it would maybe make kids love lunch more. it's a awful idea coming from the principal. And something kids may not like the food from the beginning because it may not be cooked right, or it may have the lunch lady hair in it, and lunch ladies should wear hair nets when they cook the food in the morning and after noon. And this should be for the bananas too if they don't look good you should throw it away and some other food it is past days. Well a lot of kids don't care about what they eat only if it is good. And Chips or other snacks shouldn't be taking away either mostly people like snacks more than food. It would be better just to leave the food alone and let people enjoy it.
