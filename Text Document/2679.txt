I used my sowing to help me with having a choice to use it as a long term career, I can use it in case of emergencies. I can help people out, make money, save money, help myself out, and not be a failure. If I have nothing else to do or don't have a other career idea I can just think of sowing as my long term job, many colleges have an arts and craft classes and I can get in to any of their I have an emergency and something is ripped I don't have to wait, get an appointment, wait for a few days, and get it fixed. I can just do it at home and do it Quick can make a good deed and just help people out with this for free for people who can't pay money, or you can just brighten and suggest the idea. I can help anyone I want from family members to next door neighbors. I can save a lot of money because if you're paying you have to pay a lot for a good job or little for a bad job. This way I can do it how I want without spending anything or having a mistake. If I can save money then I can sure make a lot too. Anyone would cash for someone who can do a good job. I don't want to seem like a failure to my family and sowing is helping with that, and this way I can prove to my family I can do better. To sum it all up I use sowing to have a choice if whether I want to have it for a career or not, for emergencies, to help out others, save money. Make a lot of money, and not be a failure.
