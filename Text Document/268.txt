In my opinion the students can't go to college when they are too young, they don't have too much experience, those societies have to accept the reason why they are too young to think about a career, they cannot expect something that is different just think about it, the reason they are young it doesn't mean they can have a though about their career yet.1, They don't have too much experience.ex: When you're in school the only thing that you have to think is in your grades, and your classes, so that's why your experience is not count because there is no experience for it.2. They are too young to think to go college.ex: Sometimes your age counts a lot when you're thinking about college because when you are older you can think clear what you want for your future.3. Not every student have any plan to college some of them can go. But other student have different thoughts.ex: No all the students likes to go to school. So they cannot have though like have plan to take a career. Students of high school can't expect what they want for their future, this can make harder the things because students can already start to think about college that can make more complicated, each student is different some of them want a career other don't want to go to college they just want to get a work and get money, so is impossible all the student want to go at college when are too young. The experience always have point because if you don't know what you want for your future, it can make more difficult the things. Everything has to be less desperate, because you are young can a have lot of options at end.
