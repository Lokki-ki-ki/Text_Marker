Is the most benefit to work alone because the students learn more, for example: if they work in group they need to divide all the work in always can't all the students learn all the work because a student do one part of the work and other student also do the other part, but if a student work alone he can learn all the work because he does all the work alone, and he knows about all work. Work in group also have benefit to, is more easy and more fast because all students do one part of the work, another benefit is if a student don't understand the work the other student can help to explain, in this form all students understand the work, the majority of the students prefer to work in group because it is more easy and sometimes a student don't work and all the rest of the group do all the work. But in my opinion I prefer to work alone because I learn more and understand more about any type for example if work alone I need to do all the work and I need to found all the information and do all the examples and explain all about my work, the most important about this two type is learn to working in group and working alone because sometimes in the future all will work in group or alone, in both form is good to work and always do the best and each work. Both have benefits, but I think that the best option is to work alone also because is better for the student start to work alone, for the teachers the best option is the same, the students work alone because in this form they can learn more about the student in how they work and how they think, the teachers can see the capacity of each student because not all the students work the same in this process help to all the teachers learn more about all students.
