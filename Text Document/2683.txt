First I imagine if my school change the lunch menu I think that will be great for students, I agree to school have new lunch menu because we want to try different type of food, also I think students are bored to eat the same food every day and some time students those set'want to eat at school, they bring their own food because the school provide same menu every day we don't see any change for long time that's will be my reason we want to see a new lunch menu for the school. Then after they change the menu all the student will see all the change, and they start to comment about how is the menu, of course it will a percent of students they will be not agreed about the food, that's why I recommend the principal will do a session for student to start to vote what kind of food they want in their menu. I recommend these for the principal to listen all the opinion are students said, when the menu change we don't got any issue or complain from student because that will affect the change of the menu because the principal take the decision in him self.However, if in case the principal convince about this I will give some examples about my opinion and what I agree to have a new lunch menu I support all my data because I want the school to change the lunch menu. Whatever happen about student reaction for the new menu the principal how to know have control in the students because that be a big deal if not be prepared or make a bad decision somehow the principal will prepared to fixed correctly and faster and improve a good resource for all student, but my opinion is to make all this happens because we need the school change and give attention all the opinion of all the students.Finally, we are welcome to have a new lunch menu, and we will enjoy the change what our school give to us, and for all. The principal made are all students comfort in the cafeteria and give new menu all the students will be great and celebrate to have a change in their school and the principal need to do that action.
