Some students think that summer break is good for students because its long break and students always like a long break, so they can spend time with their friends. Actually, I think that there should be year-round schools, where there would be a 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall because students get bored to doing same think like a study so, and they can have more rest. Some students think that students should get a summer long break because its long break and students always enjoy long break. If students get long break and there parents are not in the country where student living s, so they can go to out of country for example; they can go to their hometown country to meet there parents, friends and relatives. I think students should get a year-round school, where there would be a 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall because if the students keep coming school without break, so they will be more stressful to doing some think again and again without break. Also, Also, if students have a year-round school, where there would be a 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall, so they will get a short - short break, so they will be donen't have so much load in their brains. Moreover, after a long break students don't like to come school, so shorts break are better than long breaks. Finally, I think a year-round school, where there would be a 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall is a good idea because students get bored to doing same think like a study so, and they can have more rest. Also, after a long break students don't like to come school, and they get more lazy, so shorts break are better than long breaks.
