Have you ever made a awful mistake and think you can never come back from it? You can always come back from a mistake. Duke Ellington the famous jazz legend always said "a problem is a chance to do your best because you learn from your mistakes. If you mess up and make a mistake you will learn not to do it again. It's better if you make mistakes instead of being perfect because you can't learn and better yourself. We all make mistakes once in a while that's why we learn from them. You shouldn't let your mistakes hold you down. You should let your mistakes better you. Don't try to be perfect. If you do, you will just end up never learning from an experience. When you make a mistake, adapt to how you can fix it and don't make that same mistake. This is one of the reasons why a problem is a chance for you to do better. Another reason is You learn not to make the same mistake twice. You make a mistake and you learn from it. It's fine if you make another mistake just don't make the same mistake again. If you make the same mistake twice you could get in trouble. When you make a mistake and learn from it, you grow. Don't take a mistake as a flaw. You become wiser from a mistake. You become a better and smarter person. This is why a problem is a chance for you to do better. The last reason is you improve yourself. You let yourself learn more instead of feeling like you can't come back after that mistake. Your mistakes become positive because you learn so much. Mistakes were never meant to be flaws. They were always meant to be learn from. Mistakes help you become a better person by learning from them. Mistakes were made by successful people, and they became famous basketball players, Singers, Football players, etc. Remember that mistakes are to be learned from.
