Should some high school districts allow high school to graduate in 3 year instead the traditional 4 years?yes, I think high school district should allow students to graduate in years. High school students should graduate in 3 years because most students have all there credits, they can go to college earlier, also you would have another year to explore new things. Most student have all there credit by the 3 ears of high school so which mean I think they should be able to graduate in 3 years instead of 4 years because they would be wasting another year in high school, and they would have been able to go to college, and so they can already be studying what they want to become in the future. Student who graduate earlier they can start going to college earlier it can be beneficial for you and people should take advantage of it, and they would get college done faster, and you would be almost be set on their career and moving on making money because every one want to go to college and third reason is why school should allow students to graduate 3 years instead of 4 years because students would have a year to explore and try new thing maybe find a little better part-time job save some maybe even rent a basement or something In conclusion high school students should graduate in 3Â years not 4 years of high school. Some say by graduating early you would not be getting the full experience of the four-year-high school, but there are benefits when you graduate earlier. In the future I think school students should only have to go to high for only 3 years.
