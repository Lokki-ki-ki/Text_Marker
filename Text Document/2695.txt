Generic_Name3/18/2019what you have already mastered, those people they don't be alive they don't grow up, that is not true we have to create a new thing improve us self we don't like to stay the same place and nothing is impossible. I'm agree with Emerson's statement what I already know that's an advantage for us. Because it is easy doing something what we have already known, but if we never try it, and we never know if we can do it, I need to improve my self and switch my position that's a new goal. So many people they do not be alive them self, well we were born poor people, so nothing is impossible, trying what we want to do in the life. With the time we can get, and reach what we're always dreaming. You will never grow up, if you're doing the same things in the life there is I lot opportunity in the world choose a new goal you will see so many change on your way don't give up. It's easy doing what I already know because we feel comfortable doing, for example on my work, I'm working busboy helping the server we're working team work, and easy, but the problem is want to be a server, but they never let me try it I want to grow ups with a position to earn more money. Creater a new thing, we have so many skills to grow up don't be afraid doing or tying new things we want to improve us self I don't like to stay the same place doing the same things I don't see any improve on my life your life can be change a week, but you have to be a positive, don't give up, try it, isn't anything bad.
