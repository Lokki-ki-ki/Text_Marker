The most enjoyable educational activity would be when we go outside to play sports outside. The school has multiple enjoyable sports like baseball, basket ball, and soccer, but the most fun for me would be football because it has a lot of physical movement. Way I like it so much is because the strategy you and your teammate use and because u can put more trust in other people, and it's fun to play against other team and learn how they work. Or if sports is not something you like that much the science club dose different experiment like when they made a volcano they made erupt it was fun helping them. The drama club is something that most people like because of all the acting and getting to know more people its amazing Jen people that nobody notice before can become stars bay working hard and practicing all their lines and not mess up its amazing. Or may be more of a musical person theirs a classroom for people that can play an instrument they make loud but enjoy able music to dance to they are kinda amazing and then we people start singing its amazing when your body hears their voices its incredible I won't lay right now out of everything the music classroom is what I like the most over sports and everything else.
