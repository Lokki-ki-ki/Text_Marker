The school cafeteria should change the food to healthier food. They should not give to the student everyday chess pizza, MC chicken and rich, because this food are not health, and Those food are not good for student health. The school cafeteria should give to the student vegetable food been, fruit, McGann, fish, and the food that dose't have oil in it, because if the school cafeteria keep giving the same food to the student, they will not take this food because they ate every day the same food and the student will not take the lunch, and then the school have to throw this food in trust because the student do not buy this food. And the school will not make any provide from this food the school will lose a lot of money. So I request to the principal to bring those change to school cafeteria, so you can make money and the student will be also happy from school cafeteria, and they will buy the lunch. Thank you
