Many people think that first impressions are almost impossible to change. I agree with this statement, because first impressions is something that is hard to change in your life. And when someone tries to change their first impressions they always fail. First impressions are the reasons why people don't get along because they think different about each other. In my experience on first impressions are always bad, because when I'm going to talk to someone and the first thing I do before talking to them is judged them in good way. For example, if I'm going to a new school and I go my first day of classes, and I don't know no one in that school, and I want to talk to someone or be friends with someone, I'm going to have to talk to people in the new school, and before I talk to them, I always think if they are good people or bad people. And if you think that someone is bad, but in reality she/he is a really nice person. That is an example of first impressions. I think that if you're trying to change your first impressions is going to be difficult, because you can't change something that is going to happen before you meet someone new. First impressions are something that every human has in their lives, and they can't change it, because is a part of their lives. Even the animals have first impressions, because when you are trying to buy a dog, the dog is going to have a first impression because the dog is getting an owner. So that's why First impressions are almost impossible to change.
