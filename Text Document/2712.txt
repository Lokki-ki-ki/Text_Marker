"Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered", you will never grow I'm agree I think if you want to do something you can try. Think before to do. He says if you never grow, and you have already mastered. He says you will try, because if you don't try you never know if you can to do. For example if you think something and you can do, so you do it if you never try you can know if you do it. So you can try something.1. Disagree, the persons don think after do something2. Agree they can try to do something better try to do something beyond yours hands and that is a little impossible if you can do you can do and that's all. The humanity do things unimaginable and this is cool, but the thing is they can try to do is impossible understanding, and if you can try and fail that's is your problem then personas can do whatever they want and that's it.
