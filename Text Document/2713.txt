Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said that "success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm". I absolutely agree with that statement, because in my opinion I see success as a goal that everyone on this earth should somehow reach to. However, it's not that easy and not everyone is able to that. For example, my father is a successful businessman by helping others and our family, he has done a lot for me. He also took risks and failed multiple times in order for him to be successful in life. Not just because he has a lot of money, because otherwise not every rich individual is successful. You must fail in order to better yourself and learn from your mistakes, because that will benefit you in the long run. For me, I want to be a successful businessman, just like my dad. I also want to travel around the world, and gain knowledge. But my goal for know is to pass all my classes with a high GPA, to show my parents and myself that I can do it. Yes, I failed one of my classes before, but I didn't give up. As Winston said "success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm". I'm going to keep working hard in order to graduate and chase my dreams, just like my father did. In the conclusion, I think that Winston said a true statement. I personally agree with him, because in order to be successful in life you will either need to learn from your personal mistakes or others. That's honestly what I am doing right now, since I'm still a teenager. Learning from others help you develop new skills and knowledge, especially from the old generation.
