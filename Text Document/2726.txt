Prime Minister Winston Churchill said that" success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm" is a great idea. Although some people might say If you keep from failure to failure that means you can not do It, because you are not genius. But in my opinion If you don't loss your enthusiasm you will be success. The best example is when Finishing developed light blob he had thousands of fails, but he didn't give up, he didn't loss enthusiasm, after more fails finally he made the first light blob in human life. It tells me If you don't loss your enthusiasm on something thing you focus on keep doing it you will do it perfectly like what you wished. My other reason is being audacious keep trying. When you are failure to failure, your friends might say stop doing it you are not going to make It .they just giving you a suggestion. If you stop you will lose your enthusiasm on something that is attracting you just because they said are not going to make it, trust yourself keep trying to don't loss your enthusiasm. In my opinion enthusiasm is not easy to have, the only ways to have Is someone or something that is attracting me. I would like to focus on I will have enthusiasm like video games I can play for a whole day, but I can't study for whole day It will be tough to me what If I have enthusiasm on study I will be success too. Fail is not dreadful, the awful thing is loss enthusiasm that will be incurable. Believing yourself even you have many fails continue trying you will be succeeded.
