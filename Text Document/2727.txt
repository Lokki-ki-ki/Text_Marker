I recommend to the students take the traditional four years. If the students take four years of high school they are able to take elective classes. The students will have more time to do their homework to concentrate more in classes. Many high schools the traditional is four years of high school that is a good choice for the students. Students will have more experience having four years of high school. The students will learn more things in one more year of high school. The benefits taking four years of high school. Students are able to take elective classes. Concentrate more taking four years of high school. Students will have more time to do their homework. Students will be more prepare for college. They will have more time to study for the exams. Free time. Less stress. I do not recommend to the students take three years of high school. Because there are many classes that students cannot take that are elective classes take three years of high school is not a good choice for the students who work after school.2. Three years of school. More stress. The students will do not have enough time. The students will do not concentrate in classes. Not pay attention in classes. Students have to stay after school.
