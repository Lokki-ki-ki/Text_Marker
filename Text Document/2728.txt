I think that something positive and negative for these reasons if you have a work and work just 4 days for ten hours you don't have sufficient money for pay your bills, have a trip with your family or other things, but you have more time for pass time with your family, to relax, watch the TV, stay in home with your wife and children and this is good because sometimes you can't share with your family and friends so I think that this is a good proposal. I think that this is a good idea because if the school follow this model by extending the school day two hours the benefits are you have more time for study and complete all your work three days to relax in home and do your homework or get a job and work for three days all this is a benefit. I believe that with this proposal don't have disadvantages because support all students for more opportunity in the school and be a better student. In my conclusion this is a big opportunity for better jobs and better school, but we have to know that all proposal have benefits and disadvantages for everyone.
