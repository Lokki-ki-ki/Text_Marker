~Aesop said: "No act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted. "Examples of kindness:Opening a door. Giving compliments. Helping someone with bag's.asking about their day. Impact on other people:The impact on other people can be so important that even can save lives! And example of that can be that if you notice someone that is passing through bad moments but you down't know how to help the simple act of kindness of asking "how is your day?" can actually help that person by knowing that someone cares about him/her. Other ways that the small act's of kindness can change things is by making a person do good things for others. For example, if you help someone with bags, they will see how that little help makes them feel, that will make them do it for someone else or even back to you. The hole point of this is to make people know the importance of doing little act's of kindness and to show how you can do it.
