So many people at my middle school want to start an after school homework club and this because studies have shown that one way to improve student achievement is to start a homework club. Well I think this idea is not going to work because student will think that they will only have to do homework at the homework club therefor when there no after school most kids won't turn in there homework. Also, another problem is the volunteer work no kid wants to stay after school to help and if their only teacher I am certain that kids would lose focus. And the subject Iron't think that 45 minute Are enough to learn 4 main class plus the homework that's not enough time to finish homework and learn. And many people just want to go to this homework club just to finish fast I think that people that really need it should be in this group not just because they want to finish fast they can do that at home and after school wasting time and the teachers time. This one of the main problems I have with the homework club is that if kids go there they are only go to fool around with their friends. And not let other kids learn and do there homework and learn to be a middle school her my self I have seen how most kids with their friends u would think that they are master but not as much. But many people say maybe if you let them they will change but so many people have going't chances, but they keep doing the same thing. As a conclusion I think that this after school program has no use because homework is called homework for a reason and if u do at school they would not do at home when there's no after school, so this after school program will not work for many reasons like no an enough time not enough focus distractions. And people who just want OT play and not do work and volunteering kids don't want to stay extra and kids won't pay action to the teacher.
