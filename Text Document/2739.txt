It has been said that a positive attitude is the key to be successful in life. I agree that a positive attitude is the key to success in life, Because if you have a negative attitude that means you don't believe in your self, or you are insecure, so you may not be successful in life; but if you have a positive attitude, and know what you're doing is correct, so what you're doing will make you successful in life. Being positive will make you successful. If you are successful in life that means you are positive, and you are happy that you are doing everything as you want. Being successful means that you have achieve most of the things you want in life like buying a house, a nice car, going to college, or getting a diploma; so you always should stay positive, and try hard for something you want in life. Being negative won't help you get what you want, or achieve a goal or a dream because you won't believe in your self, and you will just let everything just go, and not really try hard for what you want. You make your life successful by doing what you want, and trying hard for and not giving up and being negative to be successful you will make mistakes, but you learn of those mistakes, and not make them again, or do better at something you didn't do good on the first time, so just keep trying, and stay positive, and be successful in life
