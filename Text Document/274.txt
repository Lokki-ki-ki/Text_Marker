To whom it may concern, Hello my name is STUDENT_NAME and I think doing community service is a good idea, but I think others will disagree with it. So I think we should do an assembly on how important it is to keep our planet and city clean and educated. We should have guess speakers, reward assemblies and more discipline assemblies for the students that won't do the community service. So the students can help with the community instead of destroying it with graffiti, rival gangs, and destroying public property. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
