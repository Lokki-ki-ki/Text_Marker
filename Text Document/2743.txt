Some people said that having a positive altitude is the key to success in life? How do we know this and, how can we demonstrate this on real life, well here I have three examples of how to be a positive person it helps me to be success in life. In my first year as a freshman I was a lonely and boring person I didn't talk to anybody, I was dumb I remember that I used to have a perfect teacher her name was Generic_Name, I remember that I was bad with her and know I just want to apologize with her, my point in here is that if my attitude was positive in that time things could be different in many ways and that's why I decide to change my attitude. In my second year I decide to talk with more people and be positive person and because of that I star to have new friends and more teachers like me and when a teacher likes you they help you more and that's a small way to show that have a positive altitude is the key in life, and because I'm not a smart student, that extra help that the teachers give me, it helps me to pass my classes. In my third year, well it was pretty fun because when I change into a positive attitude I got new friends and when I was in problems they help me, like i loss my pencil they borrow me one, or when I miss my bus they give me a ride to my home, or they give me a number of a bus that is close to my house, when I was absent they ask for my missing work, so they can give it to me. In conclusion the positive attitude is the key in life because it makes you friendly and more people like you because of that.
