Have you ever accomplishing something by what we are doing ? Our 3rd President of the U.S.A. wrote a quote that say "Determine never to be idle .....it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing" Many people didn't believe in him. For a way that people would like to accomplish something is setting a goal, try hard, and showing them. However, many people believed that setting a goal is an accomplishment. When some people set a goal they usually set an easy goal, so they can accomplish. For example, My sister when she set a goal she usually it is so simple that she can accomplish it. But for some people they set their own goal really hard, and they can't even accomplish it. After all for those who doesn't like setting a goal would likely accomplish something. For many people that are accomplishing something they always try really hard. When some people accomplish something they would usually try their best to accomplish something. For example, my brother accomplish something for trying his best at his final. But many people would not even try their best to accomplish something. Therefor, many people could show what they accomplish. For those who show what they accomplish is that they usually do anything to accomplish something. For, exmple, Luke show to everyone what he accomplishes for getting his mile run decreasing. But for some people think that is called show off. But what he did is that he accomplish something great. As a result of accomplishing something it'wonderful thing. Like setting a goal, try your best, and showing what you have done. Accomplishing goal would be the best thing that ever happened to you.
