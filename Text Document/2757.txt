I think I agree because you can learn more and study more and the electives will be longer, and it will get better and better, and you can use it in any class, so it will be longer and. The electives will be longer, and you won't be stress because you will have one and a half hours, so you will not be stress, and you can be good, and you will have more time for electives, and you can play whatever game you're playing because it will be longer. You won't be stress because you will be playing games because you will have one and a half hour, and it would be cool if there was one and a half in school. It would be better for kids, and they will have more time to play, and it will be better because you will have one more hour every day, and it is better to learn and have more time for school, and you will be better in every subject if there were more hours in class and. Next your grades will be better in class or in electives and that will be cool and better, and you will be a good student in class and your grades will be higher because you studied more in class, and you had time for every class or in elective, and you will be better if you had the time for whatever class.it would be better because your parents would be proud of yourself because of your grades, and they will probably buy you something and that is the reason why it would be better to have one and a half hour in class. After that it would be better for you and your parents because you keep having your grades up, and it will be better for you because you kept having your grades up and your siblings will be proud of you and. After that you could have a good grade in classes and after that your you could have a better grade, and then you can join a JV team, and you will make it because of your grades. It would be to have one and a half hour in class because your parents will be proud and your siblings and your parents will buy you whatever they want because you have a good grade in all classes, and it would be cool because you can play in every sport, and you can make it because of your grades and your parent will probably buy you and PS4 or an x box and next you can be a good student in class, and you will have a good job and your parents will still be proud of you and next you can earn money and next that is the reason why I agree to this
