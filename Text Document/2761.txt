The one place that I would want to visit would be LOCATION_NAME. The reason on why I choose this place was because, I was born and raised there. I want to visit this place because I have so many memories there. Memories of my childhood, memories of when I had my first golden medal, memories of when my cousin and I got into a soccer team together and made a lot of goals, and many more. The main person that I want to see that lives in LOCATION_NAME is my dad. He was always there for me for my brother and my sister. He took us places that we wanted to go to, like LOCATION_NAME, LOCATION_NAME, and LOCATION_NAME. He gave us everything we asked for, but when my mom and him got separated we didn't see him much. We only saw him for the weekends, and it was okay at least we were spending time together with our cousins and him. When I arrive at Texas the first thing I want to do is hug my dad, and then go eat with him with my brother and sister. After doing that I want to see all of my family that lives there especially my favorite cousins. There are so many things I want to do once I get there, but it wouldn't happen in one day.
