Do you think first impressions are impossible to change? Some people say that first impressions are possible to change by getting more in detail. I agree that first impression are impossible to change because first impressions are negative and peoples thoughts don't change. In other words, first impressions are usually negative. For example, if you see a person and he or she just has a serious face, your first impression "that person has bad vibes''. Or a type of food that looks strange to you, you automatically start saying negative things about it. Also, peoples thoughts never seem to really change you will always see that character or thing the same way. Why? Because nothing changes everything it remains if something does change, it changes in negative way. As an example, people get more cruel or companies start inventing products that shouldn't be together. Your mind won't change unless that person, place or thing changes positively. So, first impressions are almost impossible to change. First impressions can change by getting more involved and finding more information about that subject but, it is impossible to change that. In the futures lets hope this world and the people and objects in it will change in a positive way, so our first impressions can be possible to change. Things should be possible to achieve not impossible.
