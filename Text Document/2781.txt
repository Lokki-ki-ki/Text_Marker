Dear, PrincipalI think your students should have community service but I think its only fair to the people that do something bad to do community service, because for example some students at school litter and if they do, and you catch them you should make them do community service for littering. Not all students should do that only the kids that act up because if you put all the kids in that your gang be taking their time away and its gang be worst there gang get mad.Sincerely,STUDENT_NAME
