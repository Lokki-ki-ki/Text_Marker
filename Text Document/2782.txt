Dear, Principle I have a complaint that I would like to talk about I heard that you are changing the school policy on the sports and activities. I heard that us students we will not be able to participate in any of the sports or activity UN less we have a B average in our classes. Well I need to tell you that I disagree with that change and let me tell you why. First a lot of kids like sports, but some time school gets a little difficult and it's a problem for some of us because we are not as smart as others which and it will be so unfair. We want to have good grads in school to but like I said before it's not that BS
