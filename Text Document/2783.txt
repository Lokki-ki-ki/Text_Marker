I believe that Going beyond what you have already mastered is a great way to accomplish in life it will motivate you to work hard and take more steps as you are trying to achieve more goals. Some people believed that going beyond what you have already mastered is not a great way to accomplished because you will never grow and that will lead you to fall back, and it is beneficial because you have already accomplished. In my opinion going beyond what you have already mastered is a great way to achieved more goals and the more steps you take the more experience you will get than just focusing on what you have already mastered, because achieving more and taking risk in every journey that you made is a great way to know how important each step you take is and going beyond that will prove how strong and passionate you are to be more successful. For example if you are in a soccer team and your team had already won three goal that should not give you the risk to relax and think that you have already mastered what you were trying to get, go beyond that and play harder and get to where you want to be until you feel accomplished that will give you the courage to try to do more and never look down. Another reason why people should try to do something beyond what they have already mastered is it will set an example to the public by showing how enthusiastic you are in any part that you take, because you are aiming to get more and win more, and you will be a role model to the young generation, For example if someone is trying to let go because they had already got what they want they will take you as a mentor, because you at the other side never stop even though you have already mastered and accomplished more, but you are still aiming to get more, and you are still growing. Another reason to go beyond is it will impact you in your afterlife, and you will also feel proud that you never let go you take risk you go beyond your thought, for example you another person who have already mastered what they want, and they feel good with what they have already got and you GOP beyond that makes you a hero. In conclusion, you will always expect more and accomplished more if you are willing to go beyond your gains and what you have already got.
