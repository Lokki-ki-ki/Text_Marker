I agree with the statement, because in my experience everyone likes a job clean and professional, I think that is important when you witting something, it's good to take the attention from the person who reading, support the main ideas, need to have professional facts. Is important the piece of statement have a good title and one of the important things when you're writing a statement is that you need to use quotation marks. The reason why all these are important is that is easy to reader to understand what do you want to transmit in you writing. For example, if I want to write about a book about story, I need to have scenario, characters conflict and conclusion. I need that story make sense, ideas that support my story, and double check all my work to main sure that my story have specific facts, in my story I need to use quotation marks. If I want that my book cause an impact in that people, needs to have a professional title and cover. I think this the main important things that anyone need to do a professional work when it's time to make a statement or a story or anything you want to write.
