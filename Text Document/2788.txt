It's not a good idea for students to identify a career by the time they enter high school. The three reasons are because it can cause too much stress on the student, they won't be able to focus on their school work, and it can unmotivated them to succeed in their career. If the student is expected to identify a career by high school it can affect how their doing in school because all they will be thinking about is a career to pick. They won't focus on their work in class or pay attention in class which will make them fail and slump the class. That can unmotivated them and they can stop showing to school and drop out. Those are my reasons on why I think making a student choose a career by high school is bad. Others might argue that a student who has a career in mind by the time they enter high school will succeed because they know what they want to do in life. It will guide them to success in the future, they will have all high school to study about their career they chose. However, that might work on some students but it won't work on all because not everyone knows what they want to be in life. Some drop out of school cause of the stress it puts on them and just start working to make money. Those are my reasons why I think we shouldn't pressure students on choosing a career so early in high school.
