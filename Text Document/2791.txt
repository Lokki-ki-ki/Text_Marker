Do you think that we should have a program to help younger students? I think that some schools should have a program, that pairs with older students. My First reason is sometimes they go to school and don't really understand nothing that the teacher are saying, so this is where the program comes to play. Then by using the program, you connect with a random student that learn the same subject as you. And they can teach you the same thing as what your teacher taught you, but they speak to you slowly so you and the other younger students can understand if they don't understand then how are they going to pass a test or a SOL, so basically its like your getting extra help. My Second reason is, they help younger and older students is because they're both learning from each other, but it will be hard to make a program because we will need a lot of stuff, but its worth it because the younger students need to understand what they are doing. I think we should have programs in other schools that pair with older students because, so they can help the younger student learn, and make sure that they understand what they are doing.
