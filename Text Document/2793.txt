I agree with Churchill's idea that success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm; Although, many people believe that failure will take you down and make you doubt about your potential; however, failure also help you to progress, gives you different ways to active your goals, and makes you become even stronger than what you were before failing. Failure is always there, a lot of times we think failure is a bad thing, but failure is a key thing for success, it will prepare you ephor even much harder situations, if you don't fail how are you going to progress?, fail and mistakes help you learn from them, help you to become stronger, and they let you know that things are not easy. You have to put more effort on the things you want to get and mistakes are just there to help your progress. Sometimes we just need different ways to solve problems and failure is there for us, when you fail you know what you are not going to do next, it gives you choices and failure let you know the things you could've done to avoid it. When I started to play soccer, I didn't know how to kick the ball correctly, because I only knew one way to kick the ball, I failed a lot of times, but I didn't give up, I started to kick the ball in different ways, I placed my foot in different positions to kick the ball with more power or if wanted to kick it with more precision. All those fails helped me to realized that there were many other ways and not only one way. Failure also makes you stronger, because when you fail, and you are beaten down, and you go there even stronger and achieve what you wanted to achieve you are a new person, a new and strong person that doesn't give up for a simple mistake, a person that when everything looks like its over, comes back with more confidence to not make the same mistake again, that mistake helped you to become even stronger than what you were before it. Edison was asked "How does it fell to fail 100 times?", and he answered, "I didn't fail, the light bulb was a project that took 100 steps to be done". In conclusion, failure and mistakes help you learn from them, failure gives you other ways to accomplish your goals, and it makes you stronger than what you were before, I think people shouldn't be afraid of failure, they have to start failing, because when they get to reach their goals, their satisfaction when they active it, It's going to be even bigger.
