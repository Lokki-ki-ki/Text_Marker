Well if you want to make something that you always wanted to do, or you wanted to have you will fail sometimes, but you have never give up without loos your enthusiasm like the statement said because if you always give up in things that are harder to you to do it you will always be like that and them you will never go to be what you always wanted to be some reasons are the have to super ate in the life because life not always is easy to live sometimes you will have some troubles without you don't expect that it will come. Examples are that if you are wasting your time doing things that are going to ruin your life you will always failure, and you will lose your enthusiasm and if you don't think what you are doing one day you can do something that you will never want to do in your life and there is were going to be serious problems with the police, and you will jail for a couple of years. So that's why you will need to be always positive with things that you wanted to do in your life never think that you will never go to make your dream because you can make it their are people that love your family, so you will never go to be alone some reasons are that if you make your dream that you always wanted to be and your family are working hard to help you they are going to be so proud of you them you will say thanks god for all you give me, and you will be so appreciated with your family because without them will never do what you always wanted to be a good person you will have a good work, and you will go to have that car that you always dream to have when you are a kid. Nobody likes to fail even if it's something that you don't wanted to happen at you or someone else that you love or either something material because it's harder to buy something or other thing that cost you a lot of money and some else just come to break it or destroy that thing that you love, and you take care of it like that was only thing that you will love in your whole life. An important failure will be something that happen to you, and you said I know I can't super ate this and be better than I was before, so you can have better ideas how be successful in life and don't committed mistakes that just a child can committed so that can an important failure.Also, that's why I can not be agreed because I think both needs to be the same but not both can be the same but with the help of anyone both statement can be equal.
