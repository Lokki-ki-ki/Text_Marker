Should the school board add one and a half hours to school each day? School should not be extended any longer than it already is! Although the school board may think that school should be one hour and a half longer, students and parents believe that school hours should remain the same. I do not agree with the school board planning to add one hour and half every school day. School by its self puts a lot of pressure on the students and with an hour added it's going to be much more difficult. The school board should not add hours to school, since students are already used to the hours they get out of school. With an hour and a half students would probably get too much pressure on dealing with some school material. Students would also get much more school work. They would also get an hour taken away to spend that time with the family. It would also take time for the students to get used to leaving school an hour later! If the school hours remain the same then students would already be used to the hour schedule, and they would also have time to do after school activities!! Because the school board wants to add an hour more of school, the school board should listen to the parents and not add another hour. It would give students much more stress. Without an hour added, it would give so much relief to a lot of parents that won't have to fight for what they believe the school board should do with the time schedule.
