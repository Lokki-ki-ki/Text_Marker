We as a specie have lived as long as we have because we learned how to stay as one and to distribute the work. From this we learn that two heads are better than one, that there are things that aren't meant to be done by your self. We have come far from those days, we build structures withe intricate designs, we build ways to cross oceans in no time at all. I still wonder if a single individual would have been able to do it. That is why team work is important. When you are acing to a team it is because you pose an ability or skill that benefits you. As an example you work on a company that creates websites for government projects, you pose a degree on coding and in graphic design. You have been employed as a content creator, you can see it this way you are a cog Pict meticulously to fit in a larger machine. One that runs at a constant pace, it does not deviate or exert pressure on to the parts that compose it. Second when you work in a team the work loud is divide into the right proportion. In a construction crew you will always find that the cement worker will away divide the cement in to portions, this is to prevent over use of cement. In a team you will receive the amount you can Handel to prevent that someone is overwork. Like when you go to a kitchen you will see that one is piling the carrots, a other one is preparing the cake mix, an other the toppings. Everyone has a task to complete In conclusion we can see that team work has billions of benefits for every one. Like a well oil machine you team work is all about communication. The result is one group working as one. There no error each knows that the other is working on his part, like an in a kitchen one peals, the other mixes, and the last one refines there work. Team work is the most in portent lesson we will have. Because remember the will always be something that you can't do by your self.
