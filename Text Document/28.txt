Hello, my name is Generic_Name, and I am a student at Generic_School. Students at Generic_School are required to take classes in arts. In my opinion student's should not be required to take arts classes because they might need other class. First some students might want to boost there GPA, so they have a better chance of getting into the college they want to go too. Also, students might need to get the extra support they need to pass in their classes. The class work might be a little difficult for the student who might not understand what is going on in the classroom, so they might need more support in class instead of taking arts classes. Students need to improve on their grads or get extra help and should not take arts classes. Secondly Students have outside responsibility out of school like a job and sometimes when you have a job your boss might call you and say can you cover someone's shift and your boss tells you to come in, and you have to be there on time and the student has to leave early or not come to school at all, or a student has to pick there little brother or sister from school or daycare. Thirdly Some students are artistic, and they want to be in arts classes like dram, art, music and enjoy doing art classes, but all students are not artistic some students are shy or could get panic attacks they prefer to in an extra class or in study hall. In conclusion, I think that arts classes should not be a requirement for graduation because students want to get there work done, get extra help to understand their class work, or they may have a job they need to get go for and need to leave early and students are not artistic.
