I do agree, attitude is energy, and without energy we are nothing. All the time, the attitude of every single person could change radically, but that could demonstrate what kind of person who you are. Every single person who can not do their own things with attitude, is like if they're not doing it with energy. My mom change radically her attitude when she's talking with an unknown person. My cousin is the one that teach me how to be a better person just with attitude, because of some problems that we have in our family, for all the things that happen in my country, and also for the death of my uncle. I love my big brother, I want to be as him, for the things he achievement on all his life. My brother is one of the most kindness person in the world. He could talk with an angry person, and just a few minutes, he would be able to change they're mind, how can that be possible?. It's all about attitude. It's been a while for all the moment's that I lived in my entire life. Every single night that I'm going to sleep, I think all about what I did during the whole day, and I go over to think what do I do wrong, and what do I have to change to have an awesome personality, so when people talk to me, just for the way I talk, they would know if I have a great attitude. The attitude can help people life, because when you are going to ask for an application to get an employment, if you are thinking negative things, nothing is going to be positive to you.
