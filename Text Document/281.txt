Philosopher, physician, humanitarian Albert Schweitzer said," Example is not the main thing in influencing other; it is the only thing. I believe that if you show good behavior while working or simply going to school with a good behavior that some people will follow your attitude and want to have a positive way on life, however there are other ways of showing good behavior, for example you can help your mother with the groceries and help take the dog for a walk, some might think that good behavior is for the weak, but to be honest it shows that you are mature and that you know how to act around other people or places. If you continue with good behavior you have a higher chance that you will be respected in society even in your own home. Good behavior is really a life skill you need for example, you're trying to get a job, how are you going to behave in front of the employer? you're going to act like a mature adult and tell him that your looking for a job, so you can buy a house or a car. So you need to behave correctly in any given situation. It can be hard to behave correctly because some people are very disrespectful and like to get on other people's nerves, but in the end you the one that set an example to everyone else that you know how to act in any situation. don't let other people get to you because then you're going to just lash out on everyone else and that's going to make you look bad no matter what. You have to show that you are well-behaved in any type of environment weather it's at your house or at work or even at the movie theater you still have to show that you know how to act.
