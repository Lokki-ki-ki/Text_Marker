To begin with, in my opinion I think students and parents should get the choice to be involved in any type of extracurricular activities. And why I'm saying this is because the school have no right to tell you can do this and that but if they ask you to stay to finish some school assignments or after school studying then I suggest you stay after if you really want to finish those assignments and get a good or decent grade on it. Or if you want to do great in school or in any job, and you need a lot of school for that type of job then you might want to do as much of extracurricular activities. Second of all, if the parents don't think that you are going to do good enough in school after the extracurricular activities and if you don't have enough time for study sessions or you homework because you're too tired from sports such as football, basketball, lacrosse, and soccer. Then ask your teacher or whoever is controlling the activities and ask them if you can get off a little earlier because you don't have enough time for homework, studying, or FAMILY or for yourself or your friends. But I think the school should give the students and their family different choices of extracurricular activities, so the students can pick 2 or 3 different types of them instead of not having time for their own life. Like the students can pick and choose the 2 or 3 they really want or like to do, or they can pick the ones that's going to help them the most in the future of school or in their adult life, because teachers can teach the students things from extracurricular activities that they learned or did so they won't have to ask no one else for help or hire somebody then from that you can save money, and you can also get money if you help someone that doesn't know how to do that type of thing. And that's why I think it should be the students and parents choice if the students want to or not do extracurricular activities. Because the school doesn't think about the students family or what they got going on at that time they just want to boss the kids around and tell the students to go OT not go.
