Just think being in a curfew on adoption, just because we are on trouble, think about it, sometimes we teenagers we are who has more troubles because of our friends dependent what kind of friends they we have they may be good friends also bad friends, but think there are people who want they all teenager become a good person, they are people who want you to become a professional. The city is debating the adoption, because they also want that the teenagers had fewer troubles, so they can have a family that the can help to advice what is good and bad. The council it may help the teenagers to be more safely, and being out of many bad things, the council the only thing it wants to do is find a family, and being more happy, and the family can help the is out of troubles. I think the being adopted by the age of a teenager it can be really hard, for they and the mew parents, I think the because we all teenager we already know many things bad, or we know things good, but also having new parents they may want us do new things, that maybe that are going to help us in the future, but we don't know. Youngers teenagers the only things the need are parents who are there talking with us, I think it will be fine for many teenagers being adopted bye a family because he can know new life, out of many troubles, and also it will be fine being out of bad band.
