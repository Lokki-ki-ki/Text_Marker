In my opinion the Minister Winston Churchill its right, because to learn something you need to see it not just of the success fool side. You need to learn of the mistakes too. The problem of someone how never has experimented the failure, is that when this happens it's going to be more pain fool that someone how has that experience. Imagine a pro football player and he never in he's life lost, and for the first time in his career lose: he is going to suffer more and maybe get in depression because he never experiments the feeling of lose. But the football player how has he's loses and didn't stop and keep fighting if he loses now he knows what is the feeling, he is more prepared. You need to feel what is loss, It's going to make you a more prepared person, who knows what you want and how to do it, but you can't surrender you need to always keep going; is your life, your goals, your decisions and no one can't stop you.
