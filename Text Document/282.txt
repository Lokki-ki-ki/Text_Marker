I think if we never try something new we will never are going to grow more. I agree with Emerson's because in this life the point is to try new ideas new experiences is not only stay in one place like if I already have something why it can't try something different if I can move more far than where I am for example if I never try something that I always have wanted how am I going to know what it's feel. One reason if I already have a mastered in something how I'm successively to grow if I have never try it before how I will know if I am good for it For not never try before. Example If I am a person who has a mastered in business, and I am able to have my own company but I am scared to try how I am purposively to grow If I don't try I will stay in the same place where I start because is does not matter what I am mastered FPR it if I don't try I f I don't take the risk if I am not confident in my self. Unless I try to do something that I already have mastered I will never grow. I think everything depends on our own personality because there are people that they are already old but sometimes they regret their selves because they never try something that they could try it when they were young but now is too late for them, I think this kind of things are important in life is not only a bachilletor degree is what you want in life is something that if you don't try is going to stay in our lives forever and we will never are going to see that. Another example for this is that we always have to go beyond that what we already know we never can stop in one place we need to keep going because there are more things to discovered and the more fast we are moving the more fast we start growing it. So every time we need to keep in mind that everything that we do is what is going to make us to look different from others and always be beyond in everything.
