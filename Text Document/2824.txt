The determination make us to do something and do not stop until we finish, in the prompt show us a little piece of all the wisdom of Tomas Jefferson "determine never to be idle... it is wonderful how may be done if we're always doing." it makes think about how much a person can accomplish is the person is always doing something. If we are always doing something we learn more. For example: I work with my parents in construction and thanks to that I learn many things that I can use for my future. We can accomplish almost everything. Why I said almost? For the simple reason: do you like what are you doing?. Example if you want to do the best doctor ever, but your parents want you be a famous lawyer; you will strive for be a doctor no matter what. We will learn the value of the things that our parents do for us. Example: I come from of a little country in Latino America. Generic_City is a beautiful place but is poor, violent and do not have the sufficient money for live; in Generic_City if you have a car it means that you are rich, or you have a good job. But I was born in a place called Generic_City in the state of Generic_City in the rural part. Now I am very graceful of my mom come here, because if I still live there I could not finish high school or middle school, but thanks to my mom I can dream for go to a college and speak more than one language. All those reason make me want to give the best of me in everything, and always do something and do not seat and each the world rotate and do nothing for the people that I love, and my new country.
