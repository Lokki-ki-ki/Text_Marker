How technology can effect people's live or human contact?. I agree, because technology is not the best thing human created. Sometimes people say, "technology is bad because effect the family can't be together" or just they don't like the technology. I feel when people say that, is because they know technology effect people's lives. These is some reasons how technology can effect people's live or human contact. People be addictive with their phones, They can be addictive with shopping online, and don't have communication with other people. The people are addictive with his phone or the game, in my opinion is bad because they just thinks in his self. For example, if someone need help he or she can help the person because, he or she is used the phone and sometimes mean, their phone or the game is more important that someone need help. That person can be an adult or a child. Sometimes we need to be more kind and have a good heart with other people. I know is you are woman, you always shop online that is the best thing make women. But some woman have addiction with shop online. For example, some woman shop online and that good because you can be indecent and shop you own clothes, others shop a lot clothes, and they have big addiction with shop online.In my opinion the person don't have communicated with other people, does a person don't that inspiration for his life or future. For example, if that person never do something that motive or that is good for that person, literally he or she is one of more. In my conclusion, we need to be a light between that people is addictive in their phone. Because that bad for they live and their future. That was I agree, because technology is nor the best thing human created.
