The British naturalist and politician John Lubbock once wrote, "Your character will be what yourself choose to make ITIN my opinion, we do choose who we want to be. I agree with John Lubbock because not everyone has the same intentions as the people who surround us, we choose our own path, and people are raised differently. Not everyone has the same intentions as the people they hang out with. Not because I want to go to college and become a nurse, means that my best friend, that I spend most of the time with, would want to be a nurse or be in a medical field as me. Some people might think differently and say that we are influenced by the people we spend our time with. We choose who we want to become. People have their own dreams and choose their own path. We choose our own paths. I once got invited to a party where I knew there were going to be lots of teens drinking and doing drugs, so I told my friend, who invited me, that I didn't wanted to go because I knew it was bad. For some people it is just fun and don't think about the consequences. Not everyone thinks the same, and people are raised differently. We were all raised differently. For siblings, I think it is different because they are being raised by the same people and have almost the same points of view, but that does not mean they are or think the same. There could be two sisters being raised the same, but one might have different habits or opinions than the other. At the end of the day we choose who we want to be. We choose who we want to be. Yes, we are influenced by the people we see every day, and we might just take it as inspiration, but we are the ones who work towards our goals and not anyone else. We do choose who we are because not everyone thinks the same, we choose our destiny, and parents raise their children with different habits and knowledge.
