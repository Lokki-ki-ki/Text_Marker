Sometime in life, if we don't try new stuff, we will never succeed. The author, Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote," Unless you try to do something beyond what you already mastered, you will never grow", and I agree with him. Sometimes in life to succeed, you have to be passioned. If you are passioned, you will be better at everything that you do, also, we have to be passioned to look for new stuff that you would like to know more about and learn about it. If you want to grow in life, you can't be scared, sometimes for being scared of learning or asking a question, we miss big opportunities and stay stuck, also, don't be scared of what other people think about you. Other people might say that if you are good in life right now, why would you want to learn something new?, and you have told them that you want to succeed in life, be better person, not like the average people that don't do nothing to be better in life. Many times to grow and succeed in life, we have to try new things, we can't be stuck in the same thing for our whole entire life. The statement that Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, is very true and I agree with him, if we don't try new stuff, we won't grow in life. We have to be more passioned of our life and start looking for new stuff to learn, and stop being scared of learning because we are missing big opportunities.
