This statement says that "first impressions are almost impossible to change." I disagree with this statement because it is possible to change anyone impressions. Like if they are having a bad day and someone walks up to that person and does something to make them feel a little better. They can also do that to other people by making new friends and making their day better. By getting positive with them, they would feel a little happier around you and people. It can impact on how that person day changes from bad to good. Knowing that is helps that person out a lot by having a good mood now. It can change other people mood as well. They can share the positively to other people making sure that they feel alright. By doing that they can share with there family as well. Getting other people happy will make you even more happy by how you were showing other people. It doesn't have to be random people it can be your boyfriend/girlfriend. By doing that you can meet a lot of new people in life that can make you happy. It can bless you by other things in the world. Other people can make you feel better by sitting next to you if your alone and talk. By showing being happy they could be friends and get well with each other. Also, if they are going to be friends they can show each other positive mood if they are feeling down. Having those types of friends would be nice to have around with you that make you laugh and smile. The attitude that they give you could change as well by how they talk to you. If they talk to you aggressive then it would change your mood. Making sure you have the right people to have in your life is important because you don't want to feel down all the time and if you won't make you feel sad.
