It's been brought up that student should choose a career and be committed to it before entering high school. Do you think it's a good idea for students to be committed to a career at a young age? Even though choosing a career at a young age gives you an early start on researching that career. Choosing a career at a young age is bad idea.It's been proven that even collage students change a career they want to major in. So when it comes down to committing to a career at a young age there is a high possibility that a student will change it down the line. Although there about to enter high school students still need more time on choosing s career. Students are 14-15 years old making chooses that even 18-20 haven't even desisted on yet and don't even know all there interest and hobbies yet. It's been brought up that before students enter high school they should have chosen and committed to a career. It has come down to my conclusion that choosing a carer and committing to it a young age is a bad is a because of many reasons.
