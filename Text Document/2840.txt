We tend to accomplish more if we always do something. In my opinion, I think that if people want to accomplish more, then they would do more to make their lives better. For example, a teen who gets eight hours of sleep before school won't be tired then a teen who slept for three hours. The teen who slept more will accomplish a successful school year because he slept earlier. Responsibility is a big role of being able to accomplish something; unfortunately, not everyone's responsible. There are many ways someone can accomplish something, but they all start out with them taking action. As an example I'm going to use Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. Both of these men started out with nothing. No one knew who these two men were 13 years ago. But that all changed when both of them announce their new technology. If it weren't for them, no one would have these useful items: iPhone, Android, Xbox, Window computers, etc. However, the reason they accomplished all that, was because they both studied and worked hard. Inactivity can also serve a purpose in a person in my opinion. I think that people who do not want to accomplish something is because they do not want to push themselves into doing so. Another reason I think that they're not pushing themselves is because they don't have anyone to support them or help them out. Those are two main reason why I think people are inactive. In conclusion, we do accomplish more if we are always doing something. You cannot simply do nothing and wait for it to be accomplished by itself. Everything thing you do now will lead to a bigger accomplishment. If you want to be successful, you always have to do something, Even though it's little things like helping your parents cook, or washing the dishes.
