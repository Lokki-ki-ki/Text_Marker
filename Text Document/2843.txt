Hi, This is Generic_Name. In my opinion is a good idea the school allowing students to have and use cell phones in classrooms. First, at all student can use cell phone for any emergency or use the Google translation because is sometimes take minutes to find out in the dictionary. Also, because in some schools Student can't have access to use computer. Second, Sometimes teachers put some worksheet or order tints to do in Google Classroom, and we have to do by using a computer and sometimes computer gate very slow, and we can do by use cell phone device is sly. Third. We know some student use cell phone for bad propose like to no't pay attention in class or make bulling other classmate. But, I think if the Schools use different methods like to block some app for example Snapshot or other student use to bulling. Finally, It's convenient to use cell phone in class special Jen the teacher is to busy, and we can use the cell phone to gate information about math or any other class. In conclusion, base in that is necessary to use a cell phone for any emergency. We can find word that we don't know by using Google translation. It is good to use cell phone for education purposes.
