Yes, it would be nice for students to have a 3-4 of break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall. Students enjoy summer like everyone else. In my opinion, I'm a student and I would love that my school give us a 3-4 weeks off summer break, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall. So that I can relax, go out with my family and friends, and do a lot off crazy things. In summer, we go to different places with my family, we like to travel, we go to crazy water parks, museums, and we go to the zoo sometimes. When you're in school you don't get a lot of time to spend with your family. Because you get busy doing your homework and studying. Summer is the best part of the seasons. In summer is always sunny outside, you can go to the beach, play soccer with your friends and brothers, you can do skateboarding .you can do a lot of things in summer. In summer, you can get to different places with your family. You can travel, visit a lot of places you don't know and want to go there, or you can just relax at your house watching movies, series or shows that you like to watch. In conclusion I think having breaks is a good idea because you can relax, go out and spend time with your family and friends, and do a lot of crazy things.
