Should high schools extend the school day two hours. This is important because students need time to learn the maternal. I think students will get a better benefit from two hours more. My first reason is students will have a better education learning. My second reason is students wouldn't have to stay after school hours to get help, while they have extra time in class to ask any questions. Students will have a much better understanding on the subject. The high schooners would get to learn the maternal more, spend more time on the subject. They would ask more questions on the topic. Students wouldn't fail if they spent more time to learn it. They would have more practice and more additives to do in class. Because some teachers teach it way to fast because of the sols they have to finish all the units before sols. We have to be prepared for the sols, but we have to take time on it learn it. Students will have time to learn everything, therefor they wouldn't have to stay after school. Students wouldn't have to waste teachers time after school to caught up what they messed from class. Teachers have to come home to their families too. Most teenagers have jobs so some of them cant stay after school. Some students don't have rides after school. They would have a three-day weekend. Only go to school four days of the week. Have time to study on the weekends. This is why high school should extend two hours more of school. They will have a better understanding. They need time to learn the maternal in time for the sols. The highers schools will have a better knowledge. They would know the maternal on time for the sol comes, more will pass it if they understand it more.
