The American jazz legend Duke Ellington was famous because of jazz music for being so good at what he did. He said this phrase" A problem is chance for you to do your best" and what the means is that if there's a problem with something you can try your best or do your best to fix that problem think of a solution or make a solution or to that problem to do good and keep going forward to fix that problem and that's the meaning of the phrase hat Duke Ellington said. The phrase that Duke Ellington said is a good phrase and I totally agree with it because the problem you have or that you will get is a chance for you to do you best at fixing it or solving because the problem will give you a chance to do your best unlike if you come across a problem of just get a problem and you don't try to fix it or don't care or sit back and just watch your problems just pile up and then problems just come and come one after another then you have more than one problem and it's just better if you do good on your first problem, and you fix an if its big problem, and you overcome it at the end you will feel great like Duke Ellington he is now legend at jazz music, and you know t is not easy to get where he got to be called a legend at jazz music and on his way to the top to become a legend always remembered every were you go for he had to over come lots of problems the hate the way he was going to play jazz where he would play his jazz to start up who could give him a boost or help with the jazz to be known more around him where he would get more new instruments money for a place to keep all his music how would he sell his music and all those problems he had to overcome and fix, and he still made it to his dream and now he is legend. In conclusion when there is a problem It's good to do your best at it or any problem even if you have more than one problem just overcome because in the end it will turn out to be a happy ending.
