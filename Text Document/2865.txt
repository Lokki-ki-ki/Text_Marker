My example:My opinion is that all the student that can take drama, music, or art or any other class it is good because many students participated in many activities with other's school, or they made many shows where invite to the family. Or the future they can be the teacher for the next generation coming. If the student graduated from the class that they're taking be better for then because maybe some student have more opportunity that others they can be progress maybe they can be teacher, or they can be give examples how they can Dada with your class, and the people believe that all the student taking any class the people believe that they can change the future they can be better the future for all new generation can help with the people that need help with something. When the student taking like a drama class they can be actor, or they can be supervisor of the drama show, or they can help with the ideas how it can see better the shoe, movies, or the student taking music class can be compositor of music manager from any artist they can have more opportunity to practice all that they're learning about the class that they graduated. The student that have. All parents believe that your children's be better that they are the parents gave the opportunity of they can have a diploma from any class that they taking or from the high school or collage if they continue with any subject that they want to take.
