Do you enjoy people that is constantly trading to make you something else? Some people believe that is good to make people change because they might like the person but not the person's personality. I'm not agreed, became if someone loves you they are not going to try to make you change, they knew how you were and even thought knowing your effects they decide to be with you, and to love you however you are, if they try to change you means the ta do not love you the way they say, so is better to get away from them. If someone loves you they are not going to try to make you change, don't let anybody make you change, because if they really loves you they need to learn to loves you, and your effects matter what. They knew how you were and even thought knowing your effects they decide to be with you, and to love you no matter what, just be yourself do not let anybody play with your mind, because all people are going to try to make you change, and they are going to even start say bad things about you, but you know who you really are. If someone ever tries to make you change means that they do not really loves you the way they say, so is better to get away from them became it can be that they can hurt yourself.However, you can change if you want just remind if your change is a big step, and it's because you want to change not because people is asking you to change because if they love they are not going to make you change, they are going to treat you good.
