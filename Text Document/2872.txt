"People believe in praising a student work to build self-esteem, even if the work is not the student the best effort". First, you have to make respect your self, because if you don't do that change, people never is going to respect you and that is something you have to achieve. Second, making the best effort is very good in the today society probability not every one cares about how much you work some people just doesn't see that way. Third, another way that you can make your self-respect is acting with a good behavior that's what people see on a person. To be self-confident. In order to learn students needs to put more attention in class and on what they're doing. First, learning doesn't have anything to do with self-confident, because learn and self-confident are two different things. Second, if you're trying to make your self-respect you have to start respecting others first, and if you respect then they are going to respect you. Third, I believe that true self-esteem come from achievement, because you earned not is just there for you that is something you have to earn. In conclusion, self-esteem is not something easy to have you have to work harder to earned that privilege, I don't think school's have something to do with self-esteem or self-confident, but that's something you have to work to get it.
