Most people believe that working in a group is more beneficial than working alone. Other people think otherwise, they say that working alone is more beneficial than working in a group. People is different, they have different beliefs and ways to work. Some people prefer working in a group for many reasons. One of that reasons is that people in a group get more things done in less time. They say that is better working with more people because when you work alone you get bored, or you don't get motivated as the people that works in groups. Working in a group is better because people can share their ideas with the other people in the group, and they can do a very good work using all those ideas. Also, the work can be divided in equal parts, and that's fair, in that way everybody has the same amount of work to do. Some people think otherwise, they prefer working alone for many reasons. First, it is a little boring because they don't have anybody to talk and to share their ideas, but they know what they are going to work with. They can do their work in their own way, they can take all the time they want to do the work. Second, they do not have to wait for people to tell them what to do or to ask if the work that they did is correct. Third, people can edit their work many times without asking other people what they think about it. Another reason is that people do not have other people rushing them. And sometimes people that work in groups have a lot of issues because they do not agree with other people work, and a lot of times the grade that they got for that work is the same for every group member. That means that if somebody made a mistake every group member will be affected because of that. In conclusion, working alone is more beneficial because of a lot of reasons. Every person have their own way to work but if you work alone you are not allowed to get in issues, arguments, problems and bad grades.
