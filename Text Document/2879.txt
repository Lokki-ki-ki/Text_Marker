Prompt laypeople who value self-reliance define it as they need for each individual to follow his or her own instincts and ideas. Should people make their own decisions, or should they seek guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matters? People shouldn't make their own decisions, because they might do something and the need someone that's cam help then or else their going keep doing bad decisions and if they make bad decisions they can get in trouble, problems etc. Some pf the people think that they make the best decision, but they might be wrong because they always choose the right one or the wrong one it depends on how good are you making choices not always their going to chooser the right one. Just like how it happens to someone his told him that he could help him go to college but the kid didn't want to go to college as far I can see now he regrets not going to college why? Because he made a bad decision his dad could help him, but there was a problem he didn't want to go to college. Now he has to work 8 or 10 hours peer day and when he juts could go to college study a carrier that he likes but now his suffering why? Because he didn't make a good decisions. He should be working as a lawyer or Doctor. There is some people that they don't believe in themselves then juts do whatever they think is good for then but it doesn't work that way they have to make a decision a good decisions if they are under 18 years old they have to ask their parents father or mother. They can help him.
