I believe most of the students prefer to work alone, but I prefer to work with a group because we have more ideas, and we can finish our work faster. One of the reasons, I like to work in group when we are doing a project or classwork for English class is because I know my classmates and working together we can share more ideas of how we are going to create a magnificent project and impress our other classmates and specially to you our great teacher. The other benefit will be to finish our work faster because everyone in the group will collaborate with some work that it will help us to finish the work without worrying to turn in the project late because we will help each other to get the work done and get a good grade as a group. On the other hand, most of my classmates prefer to work by themselves because they do their project the way they wanted to create it, and they like to have just their ideas in their work. Also, they don't like to be working with classmates who are only playing and not taking the work serious. Overall, working with a group shows, how the students or other people become more successful not only in a business, but in classes too you can get good grades and have done an excellent work. Team work not only help you to get more abilities and ideas to work with partners, but also helps to create a strong and unique friendships.
