Dear council think the city council should adopt the curfew for teenagers because it'll keep them out of trouble. They're some teenagers who will stay outside to trouble the people. It's a good idea for some teenagers to go home at 10 P. M because they are on the street Reasoner to moose, and doing nothing but to trouble either. Will there some teenagers who are study for schools, and trying to sleep because they are going to schools. If the curfew is adopted, they should make a law that saying teenagers who are out on streets after 10 P. M would be breaking the law. Most of the teen are jail because they are doing things they should not do. Some of them have GAM but most of them not ever 18 to have a GAM with them. Some of them is on jail for no reasons, but they will find with teen who had GAM, and other surf with them. Most of the teen who have a GAM not eve there's, some GAM that teen has are found in water that people put in and all the thing that other person did in that GAM are now ever things is the people that find TH GAM. The city council and the curfew helping teen, they want all teen to stay out of trouble. Some people believe the curfew interfere in young people lives. If we look in other side of the story, yes the curfew interfere in young teenagers lives but those young teen doing things they should not do. The curfew just trying to help them. Overall I believe it's good idea teen to not be on streets after 10 P. M because they will be out of trouble
