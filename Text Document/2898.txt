Ever since, we were kids we started choosing our own character traits. It can be good or bad based of the environment we live in, how we were raised, and personal experiences. But we can always change our character traits, it's similar to an opinion on something or someone. We choose who influence us. We decide if we want to be happy or sad, making good and bad decisions all those are character traits that we choose with our minds.Let's say you are inspired by Kobe Bryant. You look up to him as an idol because, of what he accomplished in his lifetime. You either want to be like Kobe or be better than I. That right there is a character trait, the ability to choose who influences us by what they have accomplished. Some people believe we can't choose our character traits because we did not decide nor choose the way we wanted to be born, we did not choose if we wanted to be tall, short, black, white etc. But, they miss the fact that character trait is not about the things we can't change, it's about the things we can change and decide for ourselves to become a better person or be like someone who influenced us. Choosing character traits is not an easy task for everyone. In fact, adults have a hard time choosing character traits. Unlike, most kids that don't care about the consequences nor judgments, kids usually choose careless traits but as they get older and become adults, they realized their mistakes, and they choose traits with precautions. Mainly because adults have a lot of things to worry and take care of, their character traits can cost them to miss out on big opportunities like a job or a promotion. Something we all have in common is character traits, without it our lives would be meaningless we would not achieve anything big or anything to be proud of. Our lives are based off the character traits that we choose.
