I remember when I was in my country my uncle have a little store, and he was trying to grow, but he tries for much time, but he sees that his store looks sad poor, so he close the store and was asking for help and just like 5 or 4 people help him and at the pass of the year we see him building a good house he grows immediately and people get surprised by him because a lot of people didn't not bereave of him, so people get mad of him because only because he grows and people don't want to others grow. The whether is that you will never grow. I am agree that you can grow with what you have already my firs' reason is that people can grow working hard like my uncle did because my uncle did work hard and that store is there because him. My second reason is work together look there are many games in this world but some of them don't like to work together so is a game called Pug mobile and the other game is Residential of evil and this game work together, and they are getting good thing and that how every one need to do to grow my third reason is to be easy going to be sad because you don't have nothing that how the biggest company start with nothing so that how people have to thing to be angry to dream and if you take that seriously you will be someone in this life so work hard and never give up when you fall stand up is no matter how many times you fall that important thing is to never give up some people may say look at that person he or she is crash if that don't work just keep trying, and you will see you grow.
