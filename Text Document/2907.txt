People should always take the student's work as an effort because of the way they work hard and because of the best they try themselves to reach a goal. All students do not deserve to learn by lower standards otherwise students have the right to learn of the most helpful and powerful way. I believe that self-esteem comes from praising because all students should be supported by people, and people should have the right to support students in many ways to learn and help them to could reach their goals for life. The support from people is the best way to make a person feel better.Also, students should have someone who can helps out or making this person feel better, comfortable, giving ideas or finding many ways to support him to keep going and helping to never give up. Praising a student's work it helps to build self-steem and make it feel appreciated and also don't make it feel lower just because of the hard way this person work. In conclusion all students have the right of being supported by family friends or private people making it feel better and helping outre very time this person need it.
