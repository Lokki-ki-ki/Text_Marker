Don't put yourself down if you are trying to succeed, but you fail. Prime Minister Winston Churchill said "Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm" I agree with Churchill's statement because you have to work hard towards success and In general not everything turns out to our favor the first time so, you have to try again until you reach success. On the other hand success does not consist of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. Success is gain through those who choose to succeed, and you do not need to fail in order to succeed. Working hard towards success without losing enthusiasm is important because you have to be patient, and sometimes we can be inpatient so, we lost our enthusiasm we will lose interest and will no longer be motivated to succeed. Enthusiasm is strong warmth of feeling interest. Failing is alright because to succeed you are going to fail, and you learn from your lesson, try again, and move on. On the contrary side success is obtained to those who seek it. Studies show that 78.2% of people don't succeed because they chose to be comfortable and not motivate themselves. Success does not consist of failing and failing, People should be assertive that they want to succeed, so they are prepared with the mindset not to fail. In conclusion "Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm" I agree with Churchill's statement because you have to work hard towards success and In general not everything turns out to our favor the first time so, you have to try again until you reach success.
