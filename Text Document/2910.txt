I agree that being honest at all times is a good thing because you can be honest with them even though it might hurt their feelings. For example what if this boy or girl likes you, and you don't want to tell them that you don't like them. You have to be honest with that person and yeah it might hurt there feelings but at least you were being honest with. For example One day I got in trouble for hitting my neighbors' car with a soccer ball, the next day my mom told me to tell the neighbor about his car and i didn't want to tell him because I know that he will get mad at me. So I went and told him that I hit his car with a soccer ball, he was mad at me and I got in trouble. But I was honest to him that i didn't mean to hit his car. When I was a kid broke my mom vase on accident, the next day my mom called me, and she said "who broke my vase". I was scared to tell my mom that I was the one who broke her vase, when she told me and my cousin to not touch it or play with it. So my cousin told me to my mom that I was the one who broke it, at first i didn't want to her but I went to her room and tell her that I broke it. She was pretty mad at me but I was being honest with her if even though that was her favorite vase.My cousin and I where play fighting and I punch him on his face on accident, so he went to the bathroom and his face was bleeding. The next morning my aunt went to the bathroom, and she saw the drips of blood on the floor and I told my aunt that I punch him on his face on accident. I didn't get in trouble but I was being honest with her and tell her truth.It's important to be honest all the time and always tell the truth if u did something or if u don't liked nobody.
