Technology allows people to complete many tasks without having contact with others. People can check out books, shop,and play games without speaking to another persons. Has the limitation of human contact due to the technology has positive or negative effects on people's lives? I think this is negative, because the rate of oversize people will grow. People shouldn't spend most of there time on devices or inside. They should go out in the real world and see how things are. How nice people are to them. First, Being stuck in the house isn't fun because you won't meet new people or reconnect with people from your old school or meet the love of your life. Things like this is what makes people kill their self because they don't have fun. They also meet people online and let what the people online think of them. That effects a lot of peoples lives. Then, teens would be on video games all day rather than go out and do something active. That will increase oversize teens and adults in America. Technology can take over someone's life they can be hooked to it. That its self harms the brain all types of ways. Although, people are getting there things done without having to go and talk to other people. They can lose a lot of vitamin D. That can cause to death and in that way we would have a lot of deaths. And our population will decrease because of technology. In Conclusion, what the people are doing isn't right technology shouldn't keep us away from each other. We as people should stand up for each other. We should get out more and have a community picnic and be with each other. Not away in our houses getting what u want from online and letting people you haven't met and hadn't met you determine who or what you're let your friends say what they think and u tell yourself who and what you are.
