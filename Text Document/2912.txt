In this world has many countries, some are big, some are small. And they all have their own special places. Although some countries are not as that big and not outstanding, but they must have some places that can grab people's attention. So, I know there is a country described like that. Japan, the one place in the world I would like to visit. Whenever people mentioned this country, I believe that what they're thinking to are the scenes and foods over there. However, the such beautiful scenes in Japan are also the one thing that attracted me. The blossom tree is the most beautiful image I have been wanted to see from Japan. Many little pinky leafs formed numerous soft and fluffy flowers. And now, just imagine that when all leafs are falling off from the tree, that scene just looks like many butterflies are dancing in the sky. Only this image is enough to grab all people's attention from the country. Sometimes just bring your food outside and find a blossom tree, then sit under it, looking at the image while eating. I think that's a such enjoyable thing. The Japanese foods are also famous. I can't describe it, but I know there is a wonderful place in Japan where it can eat a lot of things, and also can buy anything you want. The Japanese market, the one place I want to go at most in my mind. Every time, you already can hear the laughing sounds even you're not step in. With this happy atmosphere, and walk slowly to find out the things you want to buy. How warm is it. The nicest scene is not just that, but also when the night is coming. During some special holidays, a bunch of people will come here and participate some small activities which only have at night. At this time, the laughing sounds are even louder than morning. Japan, a such wonderful place, a place that I would like to visit.
