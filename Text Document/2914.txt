I agree with this prompt about the first impression, based on my own experience and for what I've seen in myself is related or better said similar on my every day life, and what I really mean by that is: First impression that we show it won't change that easy as many people expect to change between one month to a year, not because we couldn't change it but because this is who we are, also because this is how we act, and it won't change because is part of ourselves. In addition to this prompt I think it might be impossible to change our first impression not because we can't change it, but it'll be because is part of our personalities, in my case should I say is part of how I really am, how my culture distinguish me, that's what makes me unit and by trying to change a part of me it would make me feel empty, because first impression means a lot to me and is all thanks to my experiences that I've been through. In conclusion to this paragraph I think that first impression is important, it helps you to understand how a person is, also it helps you to analyze that one person, and most of all I think it helps a lot when you're patient when trying to understand others at the first time, sometimes or most of the time people would judge others by their first impression without seeing what's really their intention, this is what I think about it, we shouldn't judge just by the first time you meet someone even if you think that person is a stranger, just give them a change to prove you're wrong with their actions and their way to treat people, thank you.
