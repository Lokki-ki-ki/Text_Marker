Dear, Principal, my name is STUDENT_NAME, and I'm a student of SCHOOL_NAME. I believe that Policy 1 is a good idea for the school. That students can be allowed to use there cell phone during lunchtime or when we have free time. And that we aren't allowed to use them in class. If you don't allow cell phone's at school all the student's will not be in the same side as you. One of the reason's that you should allow phone's at school, is cause student's would not be in the same side as you. And they would still bring their cell phone's. When that happens student's will be in the office all the time. That's why you should allow cell phone's.
