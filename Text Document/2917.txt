Although some people say that first impressions are impossible to change, nevertheless I think that first impressions can sometimes change because you get to know that person, how they act, and that can sometimes change what you think about them or they can sometimes not change. In order to think about something about that person you have to get to know them because if you don't know them you won't know why are they being like that. You can't just think something wrong just cause of how they dress. If you get to know that person you will know what they have been through. Sometimes people judge just to judge or to think something that is not true about them. For example when I first saw my guy friend I thought he was weird, but when I started to talk to him, he was totally different from the guy I thought he would be, he is fun to talk with and hang out with. Some peoples' first impression about someone they are not good. Some people judge you in how you act and how they dress. The way people act is how sometimes how they are actually are. But I mean if you talk to that person they might be fun to hang out with 24/7. Talk to that person then you will see how first impressions are not always what you think they are. If you talk to the person, and you get to know them, then you will see how first impression about someone are not always true about them. First impressions could change if you decide to talk to them. Don't June someone if you don't know themAlways be nice to people even if you don't know them. You don't know what they have been thought, in Oder for you to judge them. It's true sometimes first impressions are not always going to change. But first impressions are not always true about someone be careful on what you say or do to them.
