I would agree and disagree at the same time because their can be good reason and bad reason of why is good to extend 2 hours of school and working for 10 hours each day. My first reason is that is good extending the 2 hours helps you learn more things and catch up with any work. What is good about Working for 10 hours each day is that you will have money for college and save up. What is bad for working 10 hours is that you will be tired and sleepy. For example if you work four-day week you should work at least for 8 hours only because you need to get enough sleep, leave some time for homework. But it also can be good because you can only work for four-days and rest the week days. Working more than 8 hours you will feel tired, sleepy and frustrated. Therefore, it better to work only 8 hours instead of 10 hours because it too much, as a result you can get bad consequence or bad grades. My other reason is that I think school should not follow this model because working each day 10 hours it too much. However, their can be bad consequence of working 10 hours and extendidng2 hours in school. My first reason is that you can be tired and not listening to the teacher while she's teaching. Second reason is that if you extend the hours of school many students will be livid for staying more hours in school. I think that the school should not extend the hours is because some teachers need to be in places too, needs to rest and also needs more time on grading papers. I also think that many students have part-time jobs, and also they need to be somewhere. Some students will be tired and sleepy. Another reason I have is that student needs to go home early to go do their homework, rest little.
