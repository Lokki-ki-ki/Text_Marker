Have you ever thought what life would be like without and with success? I agree with this quote from Winston Churchill,"Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm." It's an important role that failure plays in our daily lives. Failure leads to many directions, But, if we learn our mistakes we can understand what we did wrong. People sometimes have the enthusiasm or optional energy to get thought the obstacles. Some-others don't which it's acceptable for this type of situation. Giving up faith is likely, giving up on yourself as an individual. Tools are like megalo, it helps us become the person we are today. Tools guide us to consist of good development of character. It can read our thoughts and mind as a reader, when you specifically need them in hand. For example, working on a project from school, you use the internet to find those evidence to support your statement. You may never know that the tools you're looking for has been sitting their waiting to be taken. You knew it was the item you're searching for, soon enough it was a success. Without failures or mistakes, we won't even understand what errors we had. Life would've become a lot harder, stressed, overwhelmed etc. The more mistakes we resolved, more issues fills up. We won't even be able to undo our issues. It would waste more of your time. I would argue with this fact, success comes from mistakes and obstacles along the path. It tells us what we should do and not fall into the same hole again. It takes time and effort to adjust, So, we must contribute as a whole. Therefore, no matter what obstacles we face in life, considering a side-note. There may be a tense of giving up, let it slide. You can activate anything in life.
