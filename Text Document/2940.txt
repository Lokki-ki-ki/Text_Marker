Some People Believe in praising a student's work to build self-esteem, even if the work is not the students the best effort. They believe that students must be self-confident to learn. I do not, I believe that if you give a student false praise then the student is going to get lazy & stop producing work with the quality and efficiency that they used too. In truth, I was just like this, I once had a teacher who put so much false hope and praise in me that I started to not care as much as I used too, it effected my social life & determination as well as my standards, intent & self-esteem, I was no longer able to spend more than five minutes on work without getting distracted or discouraged, eventually I came to terms with the fact that not all my work was going to be perfect, but if I spent enough time on it then it would be a hundred times better. So what is the best way to build self-esteem, well that would be hard work and dedication, lots of people think that just because they do some work they should instantly be rewarded, there work does not even need to be good, for them to think they deserve praise. The best way to actually build confidence is through achievement's, when you accomplish something, and you do it well you get this since of success unlike the half-baked work most people get credit for. Once you actually build up confidence everything in life gets easier, you start doing your homework on time, when a test comes up you would be very well-prepared to get an A, your friends and teachers start to respect you more & your parents will be proud of you, but most importantly you will be proud of yourself. In conclusion having false praise & hope is bad it lowers your standards and makes your work ethic terrible the only good way to build self-esteem is through achieving something out of hard word and dedication.
