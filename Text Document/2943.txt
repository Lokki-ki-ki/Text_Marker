" In some societies, students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school." Some students want to take a career during they study, but some students don't wanted to think about any career when they study in the school. First, for example people want to know what do you want when you study if you think is more import ants to take a career when you study, and you are young most students know that is more important because you think about you future, and you want to try to progress you life maybe for giving your parents a better life when they can to help you because they are older for work. Secondly, we have many people in the world want to progress in his life because they think is better for the future have a better life with your family, but is more important to know what do you know what career do you wants for progress your life because we have many career in the world that you progress better some students like to take a career more difficult like technology, teacher, technical and polices but any career progress your life. However, students don't want to know what they want for his future because they're thinking I was in the school I am young, and is the reason when they don't want to take a career during the students is study, but I think is important to think your future a career for helping your parents maybe your uncle, sister, brother, but we have many students they want to go to the school for have friends, girlfriends, boyfriends, and don't progress his life many people have problems about drug, drink, and fight. In conclusion, I agree with this position to take a career before you graduate because it is easier to know want to do you want to know what career you are interesting for progress your life is better know before that after because you have a career, and your mind have this position to take a career for better life maybe when you have almost done you have what career you have for making money, and try to help your family in your life
