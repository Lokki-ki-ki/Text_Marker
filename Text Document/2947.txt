Does technology have a negative effect on people lives? People believe that technology these days is a big part of society and that its effecting people lives negatively. They say it makes people feel lazy and depend on it so much and without they feel like they can't get anything done. Although, technology has a negative effects on people lives, I believe that its positive effects is greater for few reasons. First reason, it allows people to do much more in less time. We can complete many tasks without having contact with others. For example, people can check out books, shop, and learn without having to go nowhere or speaking to another person. Not only that it saves us time it also saves lives. Another reason, it helps us and others on emergency situations. For example, we are able to make emergency calls at any given time for help without having to go nowhere. Also, we can call to report someone or something that will harm us and others. Not only we can call for emergency we can also call people we care about that we can't reach. Final reason, We are able to talk to people we care about and love that we can't reach. For example, If your parents or someone you care about are in a different state or country, and you want to check in on them, you can just call them without having to go or travel to them. This what makes technology a positive effect on our lives because it makes everything easy. In conclusion, technology has a positive effect on people lives because we can save time, save lives, and contact people we care about. This why technology has a positive effect on our lives. But at the end of the day it all depends on you and how you want to use it you can make it positive or negative to your life.
