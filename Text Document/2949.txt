Do you think that people can be influence with your own example? Or do you think that they need more than that. Although some say that giving your own example is the best way to influence others because you are giving a real example, so people will trust you more, actually there are better ways to do it because if you give more than one example people is going to trust you more, and you can make a plant for take their attention. People can be convinced by looking at other people's example because they think that doing what others do is better. In my opinion we should give more than one example to the people because one can not be enough for people who do not believe what others say, so what we need is more options where they can find their influences. Giving more than one option is giving them a chance to choose them what they can be influenced by.sometimes we need their attention because that way we can convince them that we are telling them the true, and they will follow us, and they will fell comfortable with them self.in conclusion giving more that a lot of choose to the people is better because they can choose what influence they want Although some say that giving your own example is the best way to influence others because you are giving a real example, so people will trust you more, actually there are better ways to do it because if you give more than one example people is going to trust you more, and you can make a plant for take their attention.
