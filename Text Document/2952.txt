I agree with honesty because it's good to be honest and make people trust you and believe in you and because you have honesty it will get you friends and teachers will like you as a student. And also it is respectful to be honest and if it's your friend or family I think you should be honest because it's your friend, and they probably wouldn't care what you say if it's mean because they probably know that you don't mean to be mean and that you're just being honest with them. But being honest is also not good because it can hurt someone's feelings and can make them sad and not being honest could make you lose a friend and or make your friend happy. And if you're not being honest and the person finds out you could lose them as a friend, or they will dislike you a little. But if I could choose both I would because it depends on the situation on why you have to be honest being honest or not honest could make someone's feel sad or happy. And being honest or not could make someone's day and make things better for them. In conclusion:I say it would depend on the situation on why you have to be honest or not so that is what I think if you should be honest or not. But you have to be careful on what you say with honesty or not because depending on what you say it could be a big situation for you if you say something wrong.
