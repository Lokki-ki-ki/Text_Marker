Have you ever assisted an older student and a younger student from involving a program? It is better from involving a program, so they can talk to each other and communicate others, if they are struggling with some work or if they need to stay after school which is important for them to get good grades. I agree that older students should assist younger students from involving a program because they can help together and cooperate together, if older students want to enjoy an after school activity if they like being it, they can learn about social skills. I think that cooperating together for students is good because they can hang out and talk with their phones while their at school, and they can work as a group of doing a project which is good for them to do if their kind of bored, and they can work together of doing a skit or a play or act they like to do and last they should book buddy which that means reading as a group or playing card games each other. I think that older students like to enjoy an after school activity because they like to do video games because I know that some students always stay after school for video games because they like it a lot they like to play games each other which I play video games with my friend, and students might say 'Yay' I like to stay after school to play video games again. I think that students should learn social skills, because they can educate themselves of liking it, and there is an another club that is called Personal development which is a good club of social skills so that students like it a lot and there is some fun things that students like one of the activities are really fun for them. In conclusion, students should help together from cooperating together because they can get to know themselves and they can be happy, and they award themselves from accomplishing goals that they do is important for them, and if they get all A's they can improve themselves from their teachers saying" Students have accomplished their goals because they are on time to class they respect teachers, and students working and cooperating together of doing kinds of work they like to do is best for them.
