Our character traits are formed by influences beyond our control. For example family has a very huge impact on whom you become as A person because you are with them every day. Another big impact on our life is the community we grow up in. We do not get to choose who our family is therefore that's beyond our control. Family can influence you to either be a great person or A horrible person. For example If you grew up watching your father abuse your mother, you have a higher chance of putting your hands on females. However if you have kind, loving parents you have a higher chance of becoming a nice, loving person. Keep in mind we are with our family every day so were most likely going to end up like them. We can't choose our community either therefore its beyond our control. Personally I feel like the community we grow up in has a huge impact on our life because it determines the kind of people you grow up around. For example if you grow up in a bad neighborhood you will be around gangsters and drug dealers. As a kid you may think selling drugs is fine because you have seen other older kids do it. Selling drugs is going to result in you going to jail which means your going to be around other bad people which is most likely going to have an influence on the person you become. Others may think seeing bad should inspire you to be better, but unfortunately it is not that simple. Your character is usually built over the years not overnight. In conclusion the person we become is built by influences beyond our control, and we can not just change when we want to.
