A lesson that I would share would be that something the would benefit there lives like how to be good in school, because if you want to be someone in life you have to go to school and get your education. Because most job look your grades in school and a diploma and if you want to go to college you can get dealerships. And how to get good grades is to turn all your work in to the teachers and don't turn it late because that takes your points off and you don't want that and if you don't turn it in that will bring your grade down by a lot until it is a zero and you diffidently don't want that and how not to get in trouble is when a teacher ask you do something do it because they are to only going to tell you once only then after that is in school suspension and you don't want that because it is boring, and it goes in to your record well i don't that or you don't want that ether so just what you are asks and DON'T talk back to a teacher the rude and not nice .that the lesson that wanted to give you.
