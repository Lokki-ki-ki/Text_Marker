I feel like people making their own decisions will be a lot better for that person. But seeking guidance is that bad either for someone to make their own decisions says to someone else that they know what they are doing and can build something great with how their working and planning for the future. Although seeking guidance is the worst thing to do, I feel like people making decisions for themselves is better. For example if I were to go to someone for guidance or for something more, and they give me some sort of guidance or idea, and it turns out bad for me. Then I would never be able to go another person for guidance and ideas and I would most likely turn to myself. Then there's the problem that the reason that I went to seek guidance was because I couldn't make a decision for myself and now since I'm self-reliant it will be hard for me to make my own decisions. Now if I didn't go to the authorities and experts and made the decision for myself, but it still ended up being bad outcome. It still would have been a lot better for me so that I can use the experience of making my own decision to help make better one in the future. Now if you go to the authorities and experts to seek guidance and it is comes out great, and now your life is going great. Until the time to make your own decision it will be even harder to make then the time you went for guidance. That you yourself will fell behind and lose whatever chance that you had because you never made a decision for yourself and that's problem some people have because they have been going to someone else to make your life decisions. In conclusion to go somewhere to seek guidance isn't bad it's what comes out of it to help you if it turns out bad or good it will affect your decision-making to be better and worst. In my opinion making your own decision will be better than any expert ideas because it helps yo in your life and what comes after every decision you make for better or worst.
