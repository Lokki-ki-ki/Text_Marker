I think it can go both ways people can make their own decision, or they can seek guidance from experts, or authorities. But it's really their choice on what they want to do, it would be helpful to have an expert or authorities to help you with ideas. People who make their own decisions on life important matters shouldn't need no help with decisions because they have it all planned out it's called being responsible. It's always good to make the decisions on your own. Therefore you don't need no seek guidance from other people. People, who value self-reliance is doing things on their own like homework, classwork,jobs, but then they are talking about should they take guidance from experts, I would take guidance from experts because they know more. They have been there, and they have experienced everything, so they know how it is. I feel like doing everything on your own can be difficult and tire ring, and then you just feel like giving up. In conclusion I think people should get ideas and help from experts and authorities just like I said before they have been there, and they are more experienced and I feel like they can help you a lot with anything and help you be successful.
