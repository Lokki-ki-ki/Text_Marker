Have you ever wondered if you have extracurricular activities are getting in the way of your homework time or study time and if the activities you take should be up to the school or the student and his or her family? I'm going to explain why I believe the decision should be left to the student and his or her family members. My first reason why I think extracurricular activities should be left to the student is because capable on choice activities that would like to take and enjoy. For example if the school choices classes that you dislike and not enjoy you would have to be stuck with it. Also, you would be very stressed that you're in that class and that stress can affect other classes negatively. My second reason why I think extracurricular activities should be left to the student is because IDF students choose to do more activities they gain more experience in different types categories. This is a good thing because it allows students to test the waters and find out what thy like to do so they can think about studying in college and pursuing it. For example if you have more activities you have a way better chance to find something you like than less actives. However, the school might say that if a student has more extracurricular activities it would affect the time students has for doing homework and studying. They also might say they know more about time management, but some students are fast at doing homework and are very fast at studying. So I think that the decision should be left to the student and his or her family members. The family and the student should know if they are capable to have many activities and still get their work done. That is why I believe the student should choose if they want to do many or little extracurricular activities.
