My Presentation For Elementary Students Teacher Wanted me to Share a Lesson With Elementary Students. Next, I told The Students, What I was going to present to Them. It's very Important to Speak With The Students About Something interested That They Would Love, to hear About. I told The Students What They Want to be when they grow up, They said Want to be a Police Officer one Day. The other one said He Wanted to be a fighter. And I told Them to Become a police officer or a Fighter They need to graduate high School And Get a Degree For College And Take Those Classes, to have a Good Job for The Rest of Their life's. Finally, When My Presentation Was Almost over Suddenly' The Students Ask me Those That I'm going to Take Do I have to Past Those Certain Classes to Get my Degree, Also I Said it's Not That Easy to Have Your Dream Job That You Want. You Have to Work For it And Earn it And Try Everything You Could, We're You Want to Be. Motivate Your Self, Push Your Self If You want Your Career that you want Then, Always Believe in Your Self When You Have a Dream Career Don't Give up on it. When You Give up on Something You're Not Going To succeed in Life. I'll Tell My Self To Get Back Up On Your Feet And Chase Your Dream. But in Life there's No Second Chance. Last, When You Finally Achieve Your Dream Job You Can Thank Your Self for Believing in Your Self and Working, Hard every day. Because After All The Struggle, You Have Been Putting Your Self to Succeed And That's Why you Are We're at And Always Chase Your Goals to Succeed.
