Changing first impression is easy and for some people its, because they do not think nor care about it, they just do things that makes them feel good about themselves so I disagree with the statement. We have all meet people we did not know and got introduce by someone else, and we would start talking to them to get to know their background. First impressions are the biggest factor in the world we live in right now, because we all want to have a good life, so we have to present our self properly. When you do not show manner the first time your meeting someone they will think you do not have home training, and you do not care what people think about you. We meet new people every day in our life because of the environment we put our self in. The people I have meet in my life have changed their impressions real fast around because when they get attached or close to you, they show their true colors and personality. Always put yourself in a good position to succeed in life because when others see that your respectful they will put in a good word for you to feel like you earned that prize that you are being awarded for. I always tell myself that first impressions tell the person everything about yourself right there and now because you do not know what they can do for you in the long run. Take every chance you get and do good for your self and others because if you act like a clown what are you gaining from that. Like all says do not be the one to ruin your own life because you do not care take action and do something good for yourself, and it will take you to far places.
