Yes teenagers should do curfews because they will stay out of trouble and stop braking the law. They will be discipline, and have respect of themselves and others example lets say you have a child is a minor and he or she breaks the laws and always gets in to trouble the military is one of things that will keep you discipline, or otherwise they won't be well-trained. The next thing I want to add is young people have to be shown and have experiences the 10:pm weekend curfew is a descent amount of time to get them well-trained other places like military, Juvenile, and like closing of businesses. Teenagers have a hard time staying in one place of a very long time with no free time a midnight curfew for teenagers is good for them, so they can reflect and learn for their mistakes. Some teenagers are committing crimes and getting away with it, but this program well benefit them but in a matter time they will become good teenagers and obey the law. However, they will carry the behavior through their work place and public areas with good attitude and good behavior, and it will never interfere of young person's live for example, lets say a job interview and the person who wants to hire you and he or she will see your characteristics and how many times you have broke the law and getting into trouble the person won't hire you can't get a job when you have a bad record of committing crimes and facing the law so, curfews are a good suggesting with young people that you can't say no to. However, another example is vandalizing when you harm someone's property without permission as an example like graffiti, braking car window's, and invading somebody else's property. In conclusion, every teenager who brakes laws should attend to curfews for a beneficial life experiences, so they can get the best out of them, and they can prevent teenagers out of trouble.
