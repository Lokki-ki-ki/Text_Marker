Are educational activities enjoyable? There are many kinds of people that like different things. But, if you are a person that likes science this is for you. One educational activity is an experiment because there are a lot of people that like to record data and find out how something works. Many people like to record data, so they might really enjoy an experiment. For example, in an experiment that a person has to measured and put the data in a table. Some people would fight for this task, that is how much a person love recording data. There might not be author person to fight for it, but there is always going to be a person that wants to do it. Experiments might be enjoyable to some people that like recording data. Some people might be in a math class recording data, but I think an experiment is more affected. This is one reason why I think experiments are an enjoyable activity. In the other hand, some people like to find out how something works. For example, a person might want to find out how the Faces of Matter changes. Maybe that person already knows, but want to know more about it. Therefore, that person does an experiment to find out more. Some people love to learn different things. Other people will spend all their life trying to fine something out. It is may be new or not. This why I think an experiment is an enjoyable activity. Recording data and finding our how something works are just two reason why experiment is an enjoyable activity. People will fight just to record data. Other people will spend all their life doing experiment just to fine something out. These is the reasons I think an experiment is an educational and enjoyable activity.
