If you were a high schooler would you know what you would want you're career to be ? Some say that students are expected to know to the career that they want to have so that they take specific class for that career. So that it could help them active or get closer to the career that they want.Although some say that high schools students should not be expected to know what specific career they want. First people tented to Chang over time so something that you might have liked three years ago you might not like that much anymore. Second you can't really tells if you like something Intel you try it. Let's say that Generic_Name has wanted to be a teacher her whole life, but then she gets the job and finds out that she is not that happy with her job and that she should have tried other class in high school. Final most student don't really think about their careers infill the last two years of high school.actually all students should know what they want their career to be by the time they are in high school. First if student where to know what they want there career to be they could take specific class for that career. By students not having to take other class that they don't need it would help them focus more because they wouldst have to worry about having to take or study for a test in a class that they don't need. Finally, if a student was to be taking class that he/she wants they would show up to class more because they would be interceded.That's why I believe that students should know what career they want when they get into high school. Because it would help them out and even make their life easy. Even if that idea was to Chang but it always good to have a goal so that you can active it.
