I agree with this way to learn and study. I think that is a good idea for many students that can't come to the school or have a work. One of the benefits is that the students can wake up late, because the class is online so, you can take the class in the afternoon, you can stay in your home relax in the bed also if you want late you can do. Some guys work in the morning, in the night or all the day. I have a friend that he work ogham to 5pm, and he is always tired and this can help his, for the future. He can study in the night and have his class with tranquility. Some people think that this a way to lose the time, but I don't think so. Because I believe that you can be a professional person if you want. My friend don't wanna work in a restaurant all the time, he wants to be a mechanic and if he takes class online his dream can be converted a reality. In conclusion, I believe that if you want something if you have a dream, you need to follow your dreams I don't care if is hard NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE. If you have the opportunity you need to take it.
