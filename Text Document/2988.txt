The reason It's good to ask more than one person about advice about something is because if you ask somebody for something that can help you for your daily life. It might be helpful, and it might not be helpful, but now you know that it doesn't work for you. When ever you ask someone for their opinion about something, you shouldn't expect what they tell you. You should be aware that it might not work and might not go the way you want it to go or the way you expect it to go. Before you do anything tell your self, ok, if this doesn't go right, this is my fault not the person I asked advice for.Also, when you ask a person for advice, and it does work, make sure before you ask the person make sure you say thank you because sometimes people just walk away from you pretending your not even there when they know your asking them something. So just know that your thankful for people wanting to listen to you and wounder what you need or what you need information on.
