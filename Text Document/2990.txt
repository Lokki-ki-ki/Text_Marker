Would you agree that schools having partnerships with companies is a great idea?. Some may say that people won't take things serious and just not even pay attention to it and see what the partnerships have to offer but, however it could help a lot of students who need to decide on what career they want to do in life, so they won't be wasting time and money on a career that they don't even want to pursue but, not also that people could get a head start on everyone who hasn't made up their minds.Also, for an example a company like Google could offer an internship for cybersecurity. And if they see that certain people are putting in work and are making a change in the work environment or even helping out a good amount in the work space. They will for sure end up giving you a job you like, but not only that many companies have perfect benefits so that's always a great plus. It also comes down to what people want to do in life and how they are willing to pursue it. Then school is really expensive and time-consuming. For example schools can cost up too $100,000, and no average Joe has that kind of money just lying around so that when people have to get loans from banks, but then end up owning the bank money and not only are people going to school you need to go work, so people can pay for school, food, rent, car payments and clothing. So then people end up living check by check and therefore people have no time for their families because they are so busy working on themselves. Finally it just comes down to what people want to do in life and what benefits them in the long run, so they can be stable with money and mentally. And also if they would like to do these programs that schools have to offer and what works for them, but they also gotta choose what they want to do and actually like it because at the end of the day it's their life.
