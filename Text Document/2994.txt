After high school I'm looking to become an auto motive tech. Talking with my counselor helped me figure out what classes I can take to help me with my career. My counselor recommended this class called Auto Tech and through that class I got hired by Toyota. Taking that class helped me a lot ; for example, Mercedes-Benz ranked me 3rd meaning I could go work for them. I wouldn't be in the place I'm in right now if I didn't know what I wanted my future career to be while in high school. If you know what your future career is talk with your counselor they can help you figure out what classes are best for you.
