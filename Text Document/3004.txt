We're form to have different types of personalities in ourselves which it is hard to understand others behavior toward us, we pretend to quickly think that we are in control or think we are in control of subtend things in life which we are not even in control of our own distinguishing traits. When a baby is born the mother nor the father is clueless of what their child will grow up to become in life. There are two types of individual traits: the that pretend to be someone to 're not and the one that stays true to who they are. At some point of a human being life they tend to join those who have bad taste in life and always make horrible decisions and by becoming a follower of those people they also become one of them slowly but surely with time. We can decide to be ourselves to love who we are deeply in the inside and not care what others think of us on the outside. God knew the second he decided us to be part of this world how our distinctive traits would be like when we become older, us loving ourselves influence others to do the same in there life. In conclusion, we're not born to follow others we're born to stand out for ourselves. In every action we choose to do there will always be circumstances to our actions.
