For some reason I think it is not a good idea because the students are not decided what they want to be in a short time, they need to learn more things in school, because they can regret for take some careers because they have another perspective when they are a young, sometimes they lost the time at find another career that they want because they choose one career that probably don't know how was it when they was young. Still better option choose the career when you finish high school for you have more time for looking something that be for you grade and that you prefer, you need to take a decision when you choose one career, some you are good or something that make feeling well, example you are very nice doing something that make you happy or some career hard that making a lot of money, is your choice. For another way if the students are decided what they want to do when they are younger, they had more time and get more experience.
