Dear ; Mr principal I have done some research, and I think that it's a good idea to change the school cafeteria menu, to a healthier food. I know that it will be a big change, but it will help the students a lot here in school, I have some reasons of why you must change the school menu and how it will help us. The first reason is that the parents of the students won't have to be worry any more of what their children are eating in school, you know that there are some parents that want their children to eat healthier, and if we change the menu they won't be worry all the time, because they will know that their children are eating healthy food, every single day they won't be eating junk food. My second reason is that the student will be healthy, and strong, they will also be more active, and ready to learn at school they won't be sleeping that much, and they won't be so lazy, because what the student are eating right now in school that is junk food it will make them, less active and their brain won't function good though the whole day. That's why you should consider changing the school menu do it for the children that goes to school, so they can be healthy and learn new things every single day. My last reason, is that the student won't be getting sick a lot, and they will come to school more often, they won't be missing a lot of school day because of the healthy food that they will be eating from our school every day, we will also be helping their parents because when their children get sick they spend a lot of money for doctor and medicine, but since we will be giving healthy food to the children they won't be getting sick a lot. And we will be teaching them the importance of eating healthy food and being healthier.These is my reason of why you should change the school menu, so please consider this idea because we will be a lot healthier than what we are right now and our brain will function good, and it will help us for the rest of our life, because in school is where we spend most of our time, and we learn everything here, it's like our second home do this for our future and for the good of the school.
