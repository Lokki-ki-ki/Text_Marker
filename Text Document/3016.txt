Setting examples by your own behavior to influence other people is better for many reasons but still has its pros and cons.My first reason why is because the majority people around world learn and comprehend better when they have an example in front them. In addition, it is easier to influence others by your behavior because you experience it every day, and it would be very easy to set an example. My second reason is setting examples makes you a leader and when other people start to notice it they will strive to act upon that action because they were influenced and want to become a leader like you, soon more and more people will start doing it. There is only one con and that is depending on the individual and situation that person might not be good at making self behavior examples because they may have not experienced it before, but there is a solution for this problem. You can ask a smart adult and act upon there actions and carry it on. Nobody is perfect and It's okay to ask for help sometimes. In conclusion setting examples by your own behavior to influence others is a smart thing to do, and you'll be surprised by how many people you'e influenced.
