People are love challenges and learn new languages. There are 67 languages have spoken in the world, 8.9% of us speak Vietnamese. Vietnamese is on top 10 hardest language has spoken. My skill is can speak Vietnamese fluently. I can do a lot of things with Vietnamese, such as translate English to Vietnamese, teach my friends how to speak Vietnamese and to communicate with others Vietnamese. I can speak both Vietnamese and English at the same time, so that's mean I could translate from English to Vietnamese or even Vietnamese to English. Don't you think it would be helpful for your parents when you're on a family vacation? That is my main job whenever I go out with my mom, because she doesn't speak English or able to understand it. My friends are love Vietnamese, they always convince me to teach them this amazing language. When I come to my class my friend start saying "In Chao" it means "Hello" in English, I'm so glad that they love and want to learn it. I had a friend who is American, I taught him how to speak Vietnamese, and now he can speak Vietnamese like his home language.However, it would be helpful if you are in Vietnam or a place where the most Vietnamese people lives, you could ask them in Vietnamese when you need help(I bet if you are from a foreign country, and you can speak Vietnamese, they will think you're super cool). I remember that one time, I had a family reunion and I went to Vietnam. Then I was lost, I tried yell "Help me, I lost, I can't find my parent", but they couldn't understand what I was said, luckily I can speak Vietnamese, I asked them where is the police station, so I could find my parents. Overall, Vietnamese is the perfect language to learn if you want to challenge yourself. It would help you a lot if you want to visit Vietnam one day.
