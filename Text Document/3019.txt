Do we accomplish always doing something, that question can be answer in different ways on the TIPE of person that you ask; there's people that are accomplished with what they do, but there's people that not like to do their stuff because maybe they do not like to do what they are doing, or It's hard to do it, or they are just tired of it? For people that like to do what they do they have some stuff that make them feel acomplishwith what they do for example:The space are were they work at. The relationship that they have with other workers to work together. How hard is the job that they are doing that makes them feel comfortable. In the other head the people that do not like what they do, they don't feel accomplish for these reasons for examole:The work area is not comfortable to them. The people do NT have a good relationship with the workers. The work is too hard since no one likes to help Ecuador. In my way of think I would pick that I feel accomplish with what I'm doing because maybe is hard or I don't feel comfortable doing it, but I enjoy doing it is something that i considered accomplishment for; I'm the one who is doing it that nothing is going to change it and Thomas Jefferson was right it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing it. My conclusion is that if we have to enjoy what we are doing even if is something that we don't like to do, or is just a person that you are working with is not good eight to work with, but it does's not matter about what you do your ideas that you have made the work that they did and the progress that could be helpful to expire you to do more thing to feel accomplished with your self.
