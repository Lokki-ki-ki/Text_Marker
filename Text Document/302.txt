Today in the actually there are so many things it has been done and that we have to do, as Thomas Jefferson wrote, "Determine never to be idle... it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing." Image if all work together for a better life, that don't just benefit one person ewe all get benefits of a society. Determine our mind to don't wait until things happen by then self we have to get ours life ready to make it happen. We have to be useful and do something for as and for others if we all work together for a better society we can do it. Image that stead of doing trash every time that we walk, we should peak it up make a different between this past years and now, clean our own community demonstrate that we can do better every day without someone to tell us what we have to do and do it. I have seen groups of people around the world making a big difference on our planet, cleaning rivers and parks if we determine our mind to don't wait until things happen and like those groups of people make our own difference and keep do things for a better living because this all about, be useful and be better every day do something that's the key.Should something be a purpose in our community, we should be more active with thing around as make more difference and make things be possible. Be determine and keep doing something, something will always be better than just wait until some do it and not do anything. Keep it possible, productive, and wonderful
