Thomas Jefferson wrote "Determine never to be idle...it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing." By saying this I believe he meant people should never be lazy but to always be working towards something. Not doing anything and waiting for something to happen is not realistic. Working hard to get something feels so much more cherish able. Being able to out figure a way to accomplish something can help benefit others. I believe we always accomplish more if we are always doing something whether it be small things or big things, we always have to keep moving forward. By moving forward we get to discover new things and see a change. Working towards a goal helps us to become more aware and understanding of the world around us. By always doing something we are always moving forward no matter what it is. Not doing anything is bad because you are just wasting your time and sometimes other peoples time too. An example of being active and it helping/benefiting someone is if a person gets good grades, so they can get into a better collage. By working towards getting better grades the outcome is getting into a good collage. Working towards a goal is beneficial and an accomplishment. Inactivity doesn't serve a purpose at all but maybe in small aspects it does. It all depends on the type of situation. For example if someone is having a bad day you can't change their mood they have to do it themselves so in this situation you can't do much for them. By not being active accomplishments aren't being met rather someone else does it. Actively working and trying to accomplish something is most ideal. Never attempting to do something is bad. Always try your best even if you feel like you can't. Trying is always the best option because at least you attempted to do something. Things can get done if we are always doing.
