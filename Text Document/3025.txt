Teachers should not be able to design the students project because the students might have trouble on the assignment the teacher gives them over the break and they won't be able to get help because the teacher and the students will be on break, and it will make it hard for the students to finish the work and if students choose what they want to do for their project it will be easy and understandable for them and they can do a lot of research on what they do on their project and when the students get to do what they want n the project they can get good credit on the assignment if the teacher gets to choose what the student does on there project then the students will have a hard time thinking and coming up with ideas for there assignment and probably won't do good on the project and fail if students get to design what they want to do on there project then there creativity will go up and the way they think will be different and if they design it themselves then they will be more interested in the assignment then if the teacher did design it then the students would probably won't do the assignment.
