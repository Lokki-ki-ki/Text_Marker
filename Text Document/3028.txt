It is a good idea for students to finish high school in three years, and enter college or the work early ? The programs that some school districts offer to the students that allow students to graduate one year early, is not convenient for the students. To do only three years of high school is not a good way to start forming yourself. They will not have the necessary knowledge as a regular high school student. It is not a good way to enter college nor work without finish the four years of high school. First, to do only three years of high school is not a good way to start forming yourself for the future, all this is based on the future and what you are going be able to do, for example, if you do not do the four years in high school you will miss more information, that is going to affect you in the future, and sometimes you will not be able to select courses, or in some cases you will have to take these courses on summer, which is not a good idea, because most of the students with ages around sixteen and eighteen hang out a lot, so for the students is harder to focus on their thing as their courses, While the students that are doing four years of high school will have more time to focus on their courser, and they will have the opportunity to learn more. Second, the student that decided to graduated early are not going to have the necessary knowledge, as the students that are doing the four years, for example, responsibility is one of the most important things, that you will use in the future, so how can you get it, for example, the homework, projects, and team work that you will have in high school, because doing four years in high school give you responsibility, and new abilities in the process of learning, also it develops your brain, and as consequences of learning, and responsibility you will get new skills that you will be able to use in your work area, or college, while the students that graduated early are not going to be able not have the enough experience to enter a new system. Last, in my opinion the school that let student graduated one year early are not thinking in the welfare of the students, because they are not just letting the students go early, the schools had found a way that the student can rush themselves to get out of the school soon, to go to college or work instead of doing the four years in high school, that will help a lot in the future. Because it is not a good way to enter college nor work without finish the four years of high school, the students will not have the necessary knowledge as a regular high school student; to do only three years of high school is not a good way to start forming yourself for the future.
