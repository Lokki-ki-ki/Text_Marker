Do you think is a good idea to change the school lunch menu for something healthier? In these essays, I will argue how a healthier lunch menu can improve students diet and make them more secure of themselves. People that eats healthier tend to be more active and optimistic like my family. My mom has been a great example to my family. Ever since, her started eating healthier we have seen a big change in the. She gets on time to her job and has more time for me. Although, my family eats healthier, not everybody keeps their diet. My uncle was the second one that started eating healthier but, it has not shown any results out of his diet because, he eats junk food before he gets home. This behavior has make his more fat and lazy. Moreover, when my family started eating healthy, we stopped expending in junk food. Eating healthy helped us reduce our expenses by a lot. All the money that we used to spend on junk food has been going to an index fund, that will be used once we finish high school. It will be used to start a company. Some people think that eating healthier doesn't get you anything but, they are wrong because, healthy food gives more nutrient than junk food. In the world, healthy people have been very successful. In the future, I hope that the school change the lunch menu, so we can have a healthy and active life.
