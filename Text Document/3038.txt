It has been said that positive attitude is the key to life, but other people think otherwise. Due to the lack of happiness people get depressed, sad and lonely. Having a positive attitude all the time would only make things worse because you don't always have the best days. Someone can tell you bad news, like someone dying, you can't be positive during someone's death, especially if its someone close to you. Having a positive attitude all the time is not the key to life. If it was then why do so many people have to get hurt in our day and age. Imagine a heart break, loving someone for so long but them leaving you just because they didn't want to date you anymore. People are going to be positive after they've broken up with someone they have been with for so long. That's why Being positive isn't they key to life, if it was the key to life then why do so many bad people live on this earth, and want to do bad thing to others just living to 're lives. Being that you could have a happy life is possible, but you will always come across obstacles that you can't just be positive about and not caring for. Wouldn't you be miserable if you had a positive attitude all the time, always looking happy and never looking down. Something can always happen in any moment at anytime in your life. That's when everything crashes down on you and falls on your lap. In conclusion, having a positive attitude is not the key to life because you will always have a gloomy day and there won't be an escape then.
