I'm going to start explaining and giving my opinion, Technology is one of the main reasons, why the world is changing and accommodating with the necessities that the person have, for example: we live in a community that if everything is easier is better, few years ago people had to walk hours or days to go somewhere, on this day's the transport is a lot easier because the technology had increased, you can use or have your own car or you, can take the public transport and go everywhere without problems and if you want to go to another country you can! Because the air lines exist now, and you can fly to go to the country you like. So technology have a positive effect because it is helping us to make our daily necessities at home or everywhere better, a reason why I think that is because the future of the students is going to be with more opportunities to learn what they like, without saying excuses, the help of others is not going to be that necessary with technology in your hands; nobody have to advocate for you with your problems and decisions. Technology is going to be increasing, For example years ago you could not talk to your family or friends if they were too far away from you, in that edge the only thing you could do was write a letter and send it through mail and then the people who was waiting for it has to wait like one or two months; for having that note, but all that had changed too, When the telephone was invented people start buying and using, that invent, for the public in general the telephone start to be necessary for the people for emergencies like call the ambulance or call the police in case that something dangerous could be happened;years before, the history of the telephone became with new ideas like you can not just call with the telephone because is having be made it smart you can take pictures play read book and more, today the telephone have a drastic change is nothing like the old phone is something different. Technology had changed our way to communicate and transport and a lot more.
