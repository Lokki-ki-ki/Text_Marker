In my opinion I think online schooling won't benefit any student because, you don't have a teacher in front of you explaining what to do. Video conferencing is something different, you basically at school but on a screen. You'll be able to hear the teacher while she's explaining the assignment and teach it to you better so that way you understand more, and you can be able to ask questions. Looking at a screen and reading an assignment isn't going to help you much. If you have an actual teacher, she/he goes into details and shows you examples of how to do an assignment. Being homeschooled is pretty challenging. Most online schooled kids tend to procrastinate and end up falling behind. Most shy kids are homeschooled or video conferencing because of problems or any other thing that's going on with them. If students want to attend online and video conferencing, then that's fine as long as their getting their education and finishing their assignments. It's the law for every student to go to school or to do something that's related to school. Online classes are pretty expensive to pay up, so students must complete their assignments because they'll charge you for it either way. I think attending school would be better. Teachers teach you better and help you out when you don't understand something. You get less homework and maybe even easier homework to do. You don't need to pay anything for your child to go to a public school. Your student gets taught well. So in that case I think going to school is better than online class and video conferencing.
