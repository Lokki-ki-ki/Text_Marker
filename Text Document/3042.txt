One educational activity I would like to do is being in a chorus class. Because I get to practice my singing skills, I can learn from others, and also I can perform in from of people. I can do this by staying after school so I can practice more skills, or ask the teacher or students for help when I need too. I think practicing your voice skills is very important if you want to enjoy the chorus class because you can get a lot out of it. Ones you're out of the basics you can get more advance classes. Secondly I think learning from others can help you because if you don't know something that other student knows you can ask if they can help you. Also seen what other student might do you can get an example from them, or you can do what they are doing for you to get better at it.Also, when it gets to performing in front of a lot of people I might get nervous because I'm not use to that I might even forget the lyrics of the song that I'm singing, but ones you've done a lot of performs you are not going to be afraid of going to sing in front of a lot of people. In conclusion, joying a chorus class can be fun because you can be with your friends, or you can make new friends, and you can learn your singing skills, you can also learn from others and ask for help when you need too. So I think being in a chorus class can be helpful for you and others.
