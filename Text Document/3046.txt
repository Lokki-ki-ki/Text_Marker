The benefits of having a good attire is always being positive when there's a bad day, and helping others if their having a bad day too, and just always be excited to have a positive day. For example in my life when I don't have a good morning for example like missing the school bus or having a disagreement with my parents. I try my best to leave a smile on my face and just have a great and positive day. Another example is when I see it in other people would be just different because people are different, and they act different in every way. What I mean by that is that they can be either mad, sad, or annoyed, or just super excited to have a great day. Why I say that they can act different in the morning or afternoon is because when you're going to work your maybe tired and exhausted and stayed up till like 12 AM for an assignment for your job. Same with school. On the other hand there could be people that are super excited to have such a great day for work or school. Those people are probably really excited because maybe they finished there assignment or homework quickly. Another one is the afternoon people that come back from school or work there. Sometimes there's people that can't wait to go home and eat and see their family and just go to sleep after that. On the other hand there's some people that are so tired that they can't even drive or even talk to the person that they've been picked up by. I've seen it all from so many people. But again people are different in so many ways.
