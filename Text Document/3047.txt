Do you think that influencing other is important or not important? I think that it is a good way to influence other and guide them to a better way of thinking. So that they can understand the main point of the topic. My three reasons are guiding others, influening others, and sharing your thoughts. Guiding others will make people believe in what you are saying and that will make you feel great because you are teaching other what you have been taught. Influencing others can make others listen and hear what you have to say and then share it with others. Sharing there thoughts will guide people to doing good things in there lives. Like buying stuff when they are old enough to. So when they go somewhere they would already know what there are doing. Sharing there thought will help people to doing great thing in there life even though life is not always perfect you will have to make the best out of it. You have to move on in life and never look back because if you do then you will be stuck and still be thinking about things that effected back then, then now. When giving others important information it will help others with there upcoming future and teach them how life really is. When they have kids they can teach there kids information that you already know so that they can have a heads-up.
