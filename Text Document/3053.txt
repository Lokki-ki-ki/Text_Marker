The benefits to working in group are the can't share information with other's to help answer the problems the working in and if I working alone I has to put my on ideas. My tree reasons to working in group are we will work all together, we get more support of the other people that are in my group and my last reason are the I will feel more relax and the tree reason that a think if I will working alone are the I has to support my ideas by my self, and if I get confuse no baby can't help me, and my last reason are the I will feel more frustration to finish the work or if the idea the I put are not good. The benefit that I think can't help the student more are to work in group because we can't support other. My first reason about working in group are the work together and can't be easier to finish the work in time to learn how work in group we will share some information to my group and all people that are in my group has to share some information I will feel more motivation to other's. My second reason that I put the can get more support because if we work in group we can't help each other's we lair to work in group that why a like more to working in group because some time if someone no know the answer we can't help hi or her to answer the question.my last reason that I put in my essay are the feel more relax because we can't get frustration because the other's people that are in my group can't help us if sometimes we can't get confuse to some problems they can't give us support to answer the problems. That are my tree seasons that why I likes to working in group that why I don't like to work alone because some time can be more frustration to us and sometimes we can't get more homework we can't give and get support because we work in to a group I think that is easier to work in group because we can't support that ideas, and we check if that ideas is good and not and could be lest work to the other's because we can't share like one person do something and the other's person another thing about work that can't work.
