I agree with Thomas Jefferson we must never be determined to be idle. Because life is too short you got to follow your dreams don't be idle. Everyday you do more you learn more, you accomplish more as long as you believe, and have the heart for it. I don't like braking about my self, but I am always doing something. Right now I am 18 and believe it or not I own two business. I make good money but it everyday is a struggle to keep the business running good and going to school but i never once thought about stopping here i want do more i want be somebody. Frist, reason why I agree with Thomas Jefferson is because if your idle you will never make it out I promise here is an example Donald Trump he is one of the richest people in America, and he has his own airplane degraded with 24k gold, so you know he has accomplished a lot of things he can be retired living on a island right now but right now instead he is the president of United States you know why because he is not an idle person he wants to do more like what Reign(rip to that's men) said "don't ask what your country could do for you ask what you can do for your country" and that is what Donald is doing right now he is doing more and accomplishing more .also, It's okay to be idle sometimes we humans everybody needs a little break just as long as you believe. And make goals for your self you will be alright. The most important thing is that you do it the right way there are no shortcuts in life and that is why I agree with Thomas Jefferson "determine never to be idle."
