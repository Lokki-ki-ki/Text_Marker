I disagree with this statement, that first impression are almost impossible to change, there are so many examples, but some of my examples are these, for example:First, in my case if I see a beautiful girl, I start getting in love of that girl and having good impression about her, but maybe I see something wrong that I don't like of her, I start changing my good impression that I had of her. Second, when somebody watches YouTube videos, then that person watch a publicity about the new amazing iPhone 11, he has good impression about the amazing iPhone 11, but when he buys the iPhone, he looks that the battery is not that good as he thought, so he changes his opinion. Third when I go to fancy restaurants, I see a lot of delicious food coming through the tables, I have good impression and expectation about the restaurant, and I think that the food is delicious, but when I try to eat one of those plates, the food was disgusting, and it didn't taste that delicious as it looks, that's because my impression change totally. In conclusion, I think that first impressions are possible to change, not just me it could be case of people that I don't even know, people that I know, and me.
