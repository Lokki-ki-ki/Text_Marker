According to the author''To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you someone else is the greatest accomplishment '', is hard because we are in one world that the most important thing is the appearances more than what you are, most of the people prefer be and appears something that they can not be, for example most of the people when someone comment about how they look or how they are, some of them get frustrated, is the biggest accomplishment because they critic your form of walk, how you use your clothes and how you do the things. We live in one world that the opinions are more important or what others think about you, are more important because the constantly opinions from people that the only things they care about is their appearances, one of the first reason why is the biggest accomplishment try to be yourself and be individuality is that you need to appear how you are, do your own stuff, no matter what the opinions are. I am agree with the author of this prompt because is true that is the biggest accomplishment that everyday we have to tried to complete and do not do what others want you to do to make them feel better, or just do it for appear something that you are not, is good to be individuality and do your things by yourself and do not get influence with bad comments or opinions from others that are not satisficate with their personalities but is not easier to be strong in the world where the appearances have a big influence in the community.
