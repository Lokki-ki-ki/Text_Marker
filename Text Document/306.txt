I have an awesome talent, that is making weird high pitch noises. I make the noise sometimes, But in elementary school I made the noise all the time. When I found out that I could make the noise it was in 1st grade. I made the noise all the time, I could do it and no won could stop me except myself. The only reason I really never stopped was because I made my friends laugh and I made jokes. The first example was I making what does the fox say, and I made my weird noises. The second example was I randomly out of nowhere I slowly looked at my friends and stared right at them and I quickly made a lobster position and chased them well making the noise. I make a lot of noises at school but at home it's even worse. When am at home that's when I strike with the noises. I really liked annoying my sisters all the time. But, they punched me because I was being annoying because I always made the noises. The first reason they would punch me was because I sat right next to them and started making the noise, and less the two seconds she punched me really hard on the shoulder. The second reason was when I went in my sister room and started pocking her when I was making the weird noises, and she got so mad she punched me on my chest that really hurt. But, now I really don't make the noises any more I got tired of it myself. But, I do it on accident sometimes when imp laying games. I found out I had a talent and that was making high pitch noises And I used a lot. I made my friends laugh hard and made my sisters hate me a lot but I had fun with it. Furthermore, I made jokes one is what does the fox say and I made my high pitch sounds. The other was being punched by my sisters on the shoulder and the chest" man the chest one really hurt". But I'm pass that I may on accident sometimes do but other than that I'm done with it for good this time.
