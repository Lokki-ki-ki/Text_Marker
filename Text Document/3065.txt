What Ralph Emerson say, sometimes it could be a challenge for some adult, but it is more than a challenge for teenagers, because since you are a child you know how your life is going to be. If you grow up in a family who cares about you on what you do the whole day you know that you are lucky because not all people have the same family as you. When a teenager has a family who do not care about him, he is going to end up having more problems them that one who have a good family. At this point these teenagers has to decide to be himself a man of good and make proud his family and show them what you did without their help or end up in jail. When the person don't have support from their family they do what they can, so they can have some money on their pockets and have some food on the table for their family. That is what be yourself mean care about you and your family and give to your little broths the opportunities that you did not have. Most people take that decision when they are teenagers, that is the hardest decision to make because you are living all your past behind and trying to work hard and never go back to the same place. People who did take that decision when they were young they know how it feels be on that situation, they learn how to be themselves and how a real man act. This world is for the people with the strongest feeling weak people don't survive in this world. So to be yourself you have to be strong mind.
