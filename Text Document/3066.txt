My dad once said" that one day I'll save a life just by calling 911". The reason he said that is that the technology today is better than the one he grew up with. Technology today can do more things than the technology a few years ago. Technology today does have a positive effect on people because it can help people communicate with people around the world, and people can call 911 for an emergency. It helps people communicate with people around the world. For example my Uncle can't leave the country to go visit his mom but if he does, he can't return to the states. So the technology now allows him to Skype or FaceTime his mom when he wants. In fact 70%of the people around the world can communicate. All the people can now connect with anyone with just a simple button. People can call 911 for an emergency. For example my dad had witness a car crash when he was driving to work. When he saw the car flipped over he quickly got his phone and called 911. The cops came in like 3 minutes. When the cops arrived they quickly got the guy out of his car where he was flipped. So thankfully my dad was there to call 911 for him and saved his life. In fact 55% of people that call 911 save a life. So if you ever witness an accident call 911 because you might save a life. Technology does have a positive effect on people. It can help people talk to people all over the world. People can also call 911 for emergency. Other people believe that technology is the root of evil, however technology helps everybody no matter what. So technology is the best thing humans ever created because it can help anybody do anything.
