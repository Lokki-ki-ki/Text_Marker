Do you think imagination is more important than knowledge? I think imagine is better than knowledge because you can imagine a lot of things. Imagination is more important than knowledge because you get to picture or about what you want to do when you grow up or something you want to do with your life or your friends. You can imagine all that by thinking about it or just doing it when you want to. I remember one time my mom ask what I want to do or to be when I grow up I said a soccer player and I said I imagine me playing with one of the best player playing with me mom said, but you have to practice very hard to even make it on the team and I said you going to see on your television very soon. Knowledge is not important than imagination because knowledge you have to learn about it to make sure you no what you're talking about, but imagination is when you imagine something in your life that you know is going to happen in your life one day is as fun as everything in the world that can make you happy in life or a point of your life. So n√© time I was playing soccer with my friends outside in the rain and I imagined myself making it on the school team I was very happy when I made on the school team. So the next day I went to school, and they were calling out the people who made it on the school team, So I head the call my name, and I was very happy because they called my name out, and it is because I imagined myself making it on the school team and every worked out good, So I was the best soccer player in middle school, now I can not wait when I am famous and ever body know my name. In conclusion imagination is more important than knowledge, and you can imagine what you're going to do before it even happens.
