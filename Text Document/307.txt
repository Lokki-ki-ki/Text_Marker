I agree with adding one and a half hours to school each day because. Most parents only get off work at 4:00, and they need to be home before their kids. Also, if kids are at school longer they will learn more and get smarter. First parents need to be home before their kids because. If they leave work early to get home they will get paid less. If they get paid less they will not be able to pay for their kid's college. Or out of school activities like horseback riding and soccer. Or even paying for a nanny or a babysitter to watch their kid, so they can get paid more. Second if kids are at school longer they will learn more and get smarter. If people learn more and get smarter they will have a higher a chance in getting into a good college. If they get into a good college they will have a higher chance in getting a good job. If they get a good job they will get good money to help their families out someday. In the conclusion that's why I agree with adding one and a half hours to school each day. That's why you should accept my position.
