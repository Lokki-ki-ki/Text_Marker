Dear, PrincipalI think that you should allow the students of your school to use there cell phones when they have the time to. The students should have in mind that when the teacher ask them to put it always that they well. But also to remember that they have the right to use them. Will this is why I think that allowing the students to have there phones with them is ok. One because they want to time in school to call friends that may not be in the same school or if they have an important thing to do after school in they can't go. Another is if they need help with something and on one is with them. Now I what you might be saying that the students are never going to leave their phones not even if their in class. Will there can be a punishment to that person that does not flow the rules. You can assign anything to that person like after school clean up or Saturday school something like that so that they know not to do it again and that they need to lessen to the teacher when they are asked to well that is all I have to say principal.
