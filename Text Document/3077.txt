I'm not against having the after school homework club. I'm not against it because some people are failing their classes especially me and I would want to go to an after school homework club because one it would be helpful, two sometimes I forget that I have homework, and three sometimes I just want to get it over with and be done with the homework. One of my reasons that I'm not against the after school club is because the students can get there grades up and have more practice when you take any test that you don't know about. For my opinion I would like to have this club because some teachers go really fast when they are teaching and I can't catch up to them, and it's really difficult for me. Some students don't know what the teacher is teaching about because maybe the subject there learning is there the weakest strength to learn about. My second reason is that students need this class because they want to achieve in life. Maybe someone wants to go to college to learn about photography but the school they want to go to is too expensive to afford like for example they want to go to a well good college, but it's too expensive but the person who wants to be a photographer needs to apply for a scholarship that means they need to have good grades, participate in after school activity and much more this is why students like me need to have an after school homework club. My third reason is that some students don't do there homework because they forgot it at school, or they don't remember they have homework. People like me don't like doing homework because it's really difficult, and sometimes I need help doing my homework, and it would help me have in my school an after school homework club because that would be helpful to me and other students.
