Small act of kindness can impact on others by showing that you care about others. And even though you don't show a lot of kindness evens a little change on the other person because of the kindness that you were showing. If you think showing kindness is a waste don't think that because showing some kindness can show the other person that you care about them. Also, you can think that not showing enough kindness is bad then you wrong because even just a little can show yourself and the other person that you care and that you nice. Even though you're not the type of person to show kindness to others can change about what the other person thinks about you like maybe the person thinks oh like this person doesn't care about me. But when the person show kindness can change the option on what the person is thinking about you. And if you the person that is always nice, and you think your not good enough because you think that you don't show enough kindness just know if you say something nice or show that's kindness. In conclusion this is why I think showing small act of kindness can impact on others.
