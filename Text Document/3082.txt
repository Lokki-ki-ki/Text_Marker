Some people may say that opposite but to start with your aim low helps with the little mistakes that need to be fixed. People should considered setting their aim low so that they can star by reviewing the stuff that needs to be fixed, those are going to the things that are going to make you stronger and capable to lots of stuff. The people that start the lowest are the ones that overcome their dreams, the ones that are capable, the ones that set their aim's low and achieve a mark. People overcome themself because of the mistakes that some people make along the way are the ones that help by building their character and makes themself in a way stronger and more capable of lots of more stuff out there. Some people will star high thinking that by doing that they would be able to get on top of stuff and all problems that are along with that are somehow fixed without putting any effort or even think about it for a second, people should star a bit lower than that because that way they can work built that character that can help with achieve their goal by just putting a bit of effort and try to not aim high and fall short. For example a person that said that's going to do lots of things risking everything he or she may have a by just taking a single step loses it because of not being able to a list think before doing anything, by starting low can help not to put things and not taking any risk, by taking stuff step by step and learning things along the path. Setting the aims at a low risk help with not losing what it was too hard to get or to achieve, by understanding that that's what help to get far in life and not let anything fall short and just taking the time to think and overview that things that are still around and star making them better and just work on them step by step. As some may say that its good for people to challenge themselves once in a while but without risking what's around it because what's the point of being able to work so hard and by just one step that was taking without having a chance to think of what was happening and lose it all by not taking it step by step. My opinion is that people should considered think before doing anything because that what helps to get you on the top and not just let anything fall down in front of your face, by thinking that to risk thing and not having to even think about it for a second was going to get you to the top, and if you're going to challenge yourself make sure to think about it stuff before doing it.
