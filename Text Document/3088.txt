Some people or business have adopted a four-day work week but everyday they will add two more hours and today our school want to try this model by extending the school day two hours after considering the benefits and disadvantages to a four-day school week. Now I want talk about this. Although there are some people might say it's not had any different with the old model. It just adds all of extending time together and people already used to the old model. We should not change to the new model. It's good if we cut one school day off and just add two hours for each day because you will have three day off, that's sounds great, we can do a lot of things if we have one day off. For examples, you can hang out with your friends, go work out, because you already sit there for four days, you need some sports. Usually 12th grad, they don't have any P. E class, they need to have some sports to make sure they are more health. Or you can just stay at home for study if you think school time is not enough for you, help your family do some work at home, like clean house or make some food for your family.However, people should have some change and progress for our lifetime, and make it become more and more good, perfect. Don's always keep the old way for your life, try something new. It will be fun. There are a lot of first time you try already some not, for examples first time eat fish or some food that you never try before, first time go swimming or some sports that you never try before, life only have one time, and it's short, fast, don't make your life without color and fun. It will be boring, nobody want to have that kind of life. It's good for the teacher too, they are the most tired people in the school, when they're teaching, they can not sit there, they need to walk around and make sure you understand that the knowledge he just teaches you. They need time for break too. So I suggest our school should change to this model, extending the school day two hours for four day.
