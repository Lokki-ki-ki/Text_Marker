Honestly I think being honest can't always be hard or sometimes easy because, when you did something wrong you feel guilty, telling the truth gets rid of the guilt that you had, and also you feel a lot of stress. Letting the stress out in your body is good at one point so be honest! Your body will feel like your hiding something and be afraid to talk so just be honest, for an example, you broke your moms favorite vase, but she doesn't know yet. "You" may be afraid to even talk to mother because "you" won't know if "you should lie or be honest, or you might even feel like you will get in trouble. It's good to be honest because your parents will feel like they can trust you for an example being home by yourself and taking care of your younger siblings. If your not honest your parents might think that you're lazy and don't actually take care of your siblings while there out grocery shopping. Not being honest can cause problems with you and your parents' relationship. It's your job to be grateful of your parents, what they give you and how much they support you. If you have a friend who is good with their parents maybe try being like them and try your best to love and appreciate your parents at this moment. Now that you know how to appreciate your parents and be honest and not lie, let me tell you this we all know we will lie maybe once or twice, but after you can just say, "Hey I'm sorry I was not telling the truth, will you forgive me?" Everything will all be better. Be more respectful say it with love and like you actually mean it. People will feel loved and that they actually mean to you.
