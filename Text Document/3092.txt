Once a British naturalist and politician John Lubbock said, "your character will be what you yourself choose to make it."and some people believe that's true, and I agree with them. I believe that we our self choose our own character traits because no matter who you are influenced by you make your own decisions. Yes, there maybe others who will be in your lifetime their to persuade you to do bad things but its up to you if you want to stay with those kinds of people.First your character is something that make you, you and that's whether you choose to be good or bad, nice or mean. There are many types of people in the world, and they have their own characters. Secondly all people are different and special in many ways like people could help others, they could donate their time to help the elderly, they could spend time with loved ones, or they could do bad things like stealing and other stuff like that but that all comes from you, you decide to do all this thing whether good or bad that your traits as a human being. Last of all people with bad and good traits can change whether you decide to or not it's all up to you nobody else's. People can change in many ways possible you your self just have to decide if that's what you want to do. In conclusion John Lubbock a British naturalist and politician said that "your character will be what you yourself choose to make it." and I believe that's true. But it's also true that some people may influence the way you act like who you grew up with, people who were role model's to you, or people who motivated you in your lifetime. In other words I believe people choose who they want to be and how they want to act like to cause It's who they are it's their character.
