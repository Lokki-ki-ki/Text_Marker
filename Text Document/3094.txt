Is it expected for students to identify a career by the time they enter high school, I say no to this because there are many students that still do not know what they want to do when they get older. For example there are students that are waiting to know for sure on what they want to do in life, and it takes time to know what you want to do. Another example is there are many students that may not be able to afford college, if that is what they are planning and that is why it is hard because many students do not have enough for it, and that is why students take there time thinking what they want to do but can do, so they can be successful in life. Another reason why students do not know what they want to do by the time they enter high school, some parents want there kid to do what they want when it should not be like that, that is also why students have hard time thinking on what to do in the future. Students should have to worry about there future, so they end up being successful in life, and end up doing good in life and making your parents proud on doing thins that they couldn't have. It would help out students if he/she knew what they wanted to do in there life entering high school, so later on they don't have to worry much on what they want to do because they will already know. It gives them an advantage because they already know what they want to do, and so they're going to work for it, they can change there mind if they want later on if they would like. If you know what you want to-do in life it's a good thing because then you know how hard you are going to work for to get there and be successful in life. If you know what you want to do it will give you an advantage because you will be working hard to get there and achieve your goal, just be successful in life and if you don't know what to do just keep thinking about it until you know the career path to want to choose to be successful in life.
