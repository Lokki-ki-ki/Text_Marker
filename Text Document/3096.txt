The reasons I would argue for students and teachers having an after school program. Fist, the student will have more knowledge. Second, When students are in private with teachers the teachers will teach them new stuff. Finally, So they students can study for quiz and test and pass the quiz and test. There are more reasons, but those are my reasons. When you go to school you learn. The longer you stay, the more you learn more. The more you learn, the easier it is to get in collage. Collage looks at people who learn a lot, so the after school program is going to make them have a better future. Learn more and you'll have a better career. When you get tough new stuff it can be fun to learn about the new stuff your learning about. So when you learn new stuff you can be ahead of your class. Learning new stuff can make you twenty percent smarter than you usually are. Learning new stuff can get you a better job in the future. There's always time to learn new stuff. By going to an after school program you can study for quiz and test. If you get a good grade on mostly all your test then you're going to have good grades and that's a fact. Quizzes are mini test, so you should also try to pass them because both are huge deals. Passing test can bring your grade from an F to a C+. Passing quizzes can bring your grade from an F to a D+. So they bring you from a failing grade to a passing grade. Teachers and Students Volunteer to meet with those who either have difficulty in a certain subject or want to finish there homework. Why is it after school ?
