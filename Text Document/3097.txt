Well, A good attitude is always the key in our lives be good with others people, I'm agree with the statement the good attitude represent, Where we're born, How our parents gave us education where I was born they always taught me how treat people do the right thing, If we always do good things around us, Good things will come around us. I'm going to tell a history about me, my parents away before I go to school they always told me be respectful with the older people if you see people when your walking say hi, Good morning no just old people, kids like you need to respect if you respect they will treat you with respect, Then I was walking in the street I away remember, What mom told me one month after I forgot what mom told me one month before, I went to school there was a party at school the teacher who was my science teacher he was so rude with me what I did was so rude too, but I remember just at the moment what my mom told me what I did when I remember what mom told me, I just turn around and walk away, I said, Woo ow his parents didn't taught him how to treat people with respect the night was so fun the party over around 4:00 am, When I get home my mom was so worried about me because I didn't tell her, The days pass, and you don't know the time is a clock never stop if you see around you your parents are getting older in that time you want the days pass too fast, I'm 18 now I see what my parents told me, how beautiful is seen kids, boys, old people together is beautiful when you see there's respect each other respect is the key for many ways to see people they are like you to get respect others and wherever you go everyone will treat you with respect if you respect them the positive attitude always bring you good things, your future is in your hands don't waste your time is running respect others people the positive attitude will bring you a good job and new opportunities.
