The school board shouldn't add one and half hours to school each day. To begin one reason I think they shouldn't is that a lot of kids who play sports or clubs after school might not be able to because they don't have time to learn about how life is and how difficult it is and people's life difficulties. One example is that some kids play videos and since they don't have lots of time outside of school they might just play video game instead of sports and if you give them more time out of school more opportunities students will have. Secondly Students will be more tired and less focus because if students have more time in school the earlier they will have to sleep and most students don't fall asleep early also students have homework since they well most likely be tired from school they might take a nap and there might either wake up too late to do homework or not have time to finish all there homework. Thirdly more students will not want to be in school and may drop out from either too much stress or they just don't want to be in school because the longer time there in school the more tired they are and less time they have to do what makes them feel relaxed or not have time to do what they love to do. Students also might not have time to make friends because there focusing on school, and it might ruin there social skill and conversation with strangers outside of school. Lastly less amount of time they have to spend with their families because they would have to go to school for extra time and as soon as they get home they have to do homework and honestly by the time there done going to be most likely tired to do anything beside resting or sleeping. Also, some students have younger siblings to take care of after school so that would put more stress on a student and either a family would have to pay for a babysitter or some families don't have money to pay for one, so parents might take there student out of school just to take care of their sibling and so the extra time in school wouldn't help him. To conclude those are the main reasons why I think we shouldn't have more school hours in school.
