Have you ever found something on the ground and picked it up and pretended that it been yours? That right there is called a lie and it's awful because you don't know if that money you found or that toy you found was somebody's when they come back to look for it its gone because somebody else just walked away with there stuff that they spent there money on. When I was a kid I would always see this stuff, people would drop there stuff and I would pick it up and give it back to them or tell them they dropped it and hand it over to them. Usually when people find stuff just lying around the first thing to come to mind is take it but that isn't very smart because you never know who's it is or where it came from, and taking if it's not your is stealing. Many people say leave it where you found it because people will come back looking for there stuff, because nobody leaves there stuff somewhere and then just walks away without knowing or caring. I know many schools teach this because when I was at my elementary school there would always be signs all over the place talking about leave it where you found it and don't take what's not yours, many kids listened to that in my school but sometimes people just don't care and that's not okay because they might not even need it and just want it. Needing it is like you have to have something or it's really important to you and if you don't have it you would have to struggle to find, but if you really need something then I am pretty sure you can buy it from any nearby stores. Wanting something is like you don't have to have it, but you just want it to brag or to have fun with it or you just don't really care and don't need it but just want to take something that you can buy, even though you're not struggling or going through any trouble you just felt like doing the action you did and don't really care. If you find something don't take ITF you see somebody drop something give it back to theme aware of your actionsDont listen to pear pressure Be helpful Be kinds lesson is very important because many people now don't do this stuff and just take and many parent don't really care anymore so that's when the school has to step in and teach the young kids what's wrong and what's right. When somebody drops something always hand it back why you say, because if you drop something, and you think you lost it, and it was your favorite toy or a toy that you spent your money on and really liked it, what if somebody just saw it and took it how would you feel, probably mad, sad, upset, you would be very upset because your favorite toy is gone, and you can't get it back because the person that took it does not really care and didn't need it but just wanted it or took it because there was nobody there. Now imagine you drop your favorite toy and somebody saw you drop it and ran up to you to give it back to you how would you feel, probably happy, proud, delighted, because that person gave it back and didn't have any intentions with it or didn't think about even taking it they just wanted to give it back because they are not the owners of the item that was found on the ground but the owner that dropped it is right in front of them, the owner of the item could have just walked away and never realized they dropped it until they needed to use it for something. I lost my iPad years ago because the person that saw it took it and didn't really care do I know who it is no because I never paid attention to who took it I just was really happy and didn't realize what they were going to do, and didn't think of this stuff happening to me when it did happen I was very upset and had to use my moms phone until my dad would buy me a phone. That's why this lesson is very important to show kids that taking something that isn't yours is not smart or needed, many people don't care but when it happens to them, they care and ask there self why did this happen to me is because you didn't leave what you took where it was found so the person that saw the item you own they did the same thing you just did, they took it, and you will probably never see it again. Many items are very expensive like phones people love there phones and can never get off it and when somebody cracks there phone they go nuts and get mad because that crack can make your phone glitch or tweak, but if somebody lost there phone I already know that they would be so mad because nowadays, phones are over $1,000, and they can be more expensive than that so when they lose there phone and find out somebody took it they wouldn't be very happy and probably go everywhere to look for it and would do anything to get it back, because phones are so important to people, and sometimes they need it for calling somebody to pick them up, or they would be stuck at a place for a long time or to call for help if somebody needs it. If somebody stole my phone I would get very angry and sad because the item I just lost and somebody picked it up or stole it is very expensive and isn't easy to buy because new phones are like the cost of a used car that you can buy from the internet.
