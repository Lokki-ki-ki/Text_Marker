Dear Generic_Name It is an honor for me to respond your statement about human individuality and I agree with your statement and I believe that be yourself in a world is hard. The world is something that the human we can not answer and be yourself is definitely the same is hard everything is hard, but you can get a lot of achievements for do and treat the best the can. First, I think when you are alone and the city or other place, and you got this situation you are alone there is no family, friends, parents nobody is there, but you have to be sure that you can live without people that grow and start think what is going to happen. I believe that everyone can do everything that we want each achieve or something else because everyone can be smart, we are the people that we want to be and yes if you are alone in the big world you are going to scare first you have to work and pay everything that you want, but that is help you to get the greatest accomplishment. Second, be yourself is everything that all people want because to can express the real person that you are not a fake person cause if you are in a meeting or school or whatever place you have to be yourself and demonstrate the person who are you inside the feeling the have all the characteristics that you have the point is to demonstrate the world the can be yourself and make more to get something else and be something else. Next, demonstrate the person who are you one reason is you can get more friends because you are showing to other person who is a real you are. In conclusion, be yourself in a world is more better than not we have to continue trying the person who want to be for get more achievements and other things. Thanks for give me this opportunity to response you what I think and give you my opinion. Sincerely.
