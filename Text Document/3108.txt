Why do people need to follow their own instincts and ideas? I think people should make their own decision because they have to follow their own instincts and their own ideas. They have to believe themselves because if you not believe on you, so no one can believe on you too.First, I think people should make their own decision because they have to believe on themselves. They don't have to think as much because the ideas come from their mine not from someone else. When they have to think of some ideas that mean their don't have to ask ideas from anyone. When they have to do some writing that mean they don't have to copy from someone or from internet. Secondly, I think people have to follow their own instinct because when something happen to you that mean you don't have to wait for someone to help you solve a problem. They don't have to seek for guidance because you have confidence in yourselves already. In addition, They have to believe on themselves because if you not believe on you by the way no one can't believe on you too. For example, like when you have to do a presentation in class, and you have to present in front of teacher, but you not believe that you can do it, so it means the teacher might not believe on you too. After that is might affect to your grade because when you have to present you keep asking teacher that you say the right thing or wrong. Conclusion, I believe that people should make their own decision because they have to believe on themselves first before they ask for some help. They have to believe on themselves because if you not believe on you by the way no one else can't believe on you too. Lastly I hope all people believe on themselves first because if you just listen to someone else, but you not listen to yourselves that mean you not have enough value.
