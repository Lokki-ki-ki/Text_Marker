I agree with the actor Ralph Waldo Emerson, Most the time in order to be successful we must know the most important tip about what we're doing. For example my pastie's been taught me how can I master a lot situation in my life now. I am confident in every single step or move that I'm doing. At time, I may not succeed the way I want, but I took my mistake like a lesson which I will be more careful in my next move. I understand that the only way to grew up in life, business, etc. is doing what we know better and for that we need to applying our past too. In our past is the best experiences, that we also have learned the most important lesson of our life. In my personal life I have been victim of humiliation by my ex-husband, now I am trying to heal the pain that he left in my heart. This time I am learned a huge lesson with the relationship. And now I will do better in this part of my personal life with my next partner.
