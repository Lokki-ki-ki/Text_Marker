Activities that are being done in school will health benefit for most students. School activities will bring enjoyment for some students, and they would see there friends which makes them happy. I agree that the decision regarding extracurricular involvement should be left to students and their families because of students needing more time on homework and studying, students wanting more time on other hobbies, and students would like to choose the right activities for them. Students would like to have their own time to finish homework and studying. Some students would like to be involved in extracurricular activities which makes some of them having a hard time in school or having good grades, because they don't have the time for studying and completing homework, and also it makes them stressful because they might be having hard time to understand the teacher in the classroom. Students would like to have more time on other hobbies that they enjoy to having. Having extracurricular activities after school or before school will be affecting the student in some ways like students won't be having much time to hang out with friends or playing video games, and also it would make the students exhausted for school or free time. Students choosing what activity they want will be easy for them. Students would probably choose the activities that there good at or if they want to try it, and it helps them to try out new activity because it will be health benefit for them, and they get to meet new people. Some might say that the decision regarding extracurricular involvement should be left to students and their families, because they will need more time on homework and studying;however, being involved in extracurricular activities can help with scholarships.
