No I think students should not have any cell phones at school at all because there could a lot of noises, and maybe it could be distracting to other students. That's why I think students should not have cell phones during the school time. To begin with student should not have cell phones during the school time because it could make a lot of noises. So if you have a cell phone right and your in class and its in high volume, and you receive a call or a text message that's not right because teachers are trying to teach you and all your doing is making noise. That's why I think we should not have cell phones during the school time. In addition, I think we should not have cell phones in school hours because it could be distracting to the students or even the teachers, because last week there was a girl texting during class and the teacher saw her, so he had to stop his lesson and take her phone away and rite her a referral. So that's distracting and a waist of time isn't it. That's why I think they should not have cell phones during school hours because it's distracting. Those are the reasons why they should not allow cell phones during the school hours because it is distracting, and it makes to many noises.
