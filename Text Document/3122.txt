I agree honesty is the best policy, but sometimes honesty is bad because you can hurt people feeling and people don't fell the same with you when your hones with them. Also, someone that like when people are honesty with them, they won't care because it is good to be honesty with them because what if there doing something bad that you don't like and your hones with them, and you tell fixing that thing that where doing that you don't like. Another thing if you get in trouble in school be hones with your teacher and tell them what happened be hones don't ever lie to your teacher. Then if you're in a relationship with some and you don't like them anymore don't be shy then the true be hones. Finally if you go to a store, and you tell something from the store, and they tell you are you stealing something tell them the true because if you leave without paying you can get in trouble with the police that why be hones with some ask you if your stealing something tell them then true be hones. That why I agree with honesty.
