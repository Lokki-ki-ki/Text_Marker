Do you think we choose our own character traits, or is our character formed by influences beyond our control? I believe that we choose our own character. I don't think that our character is formed by influences. Our character is what we make out of it. Some reasons why I think we choose our own character is because of the way we are, the way we treat people, and the way we tell ourselves to be. One of the reasons why I think we choose our own character is because of the way we are. The way we are tells people about ourselves a lot. It describes who we are. For example some people who know my sisters and I so well say that we're all so different. That's because we are all our own character. Some siblings look up one another, so it makes them want to be like their older sister so, they don't get to make their own character. Another reason is the way we treat people. The way we treat people is part of our character. It helps other people see the way you are. They judge you to see if you're nice or mean. Also, what you hear about yourself makes you want to act different. The last reason is the way you choose to be. You get to pick who you want to be. Although some people say that your character is already formed by influences. They may have a point because they say that it's how your family is. If your family taught you to be a certain way then you would grow up being that way because that's the way you grew up, but at the end of they day you are you. Your family might've taught you to be a certain way, but you can always change how you want to be. In conclusion, I believe that we choose our own character. I don't think that our character is formed by influences. Our character is what we make out of it. Some reasons why I think we choose our own character is because of the way we are, the way we treat people, and the way we tell ourselves to be. We are our own character.
