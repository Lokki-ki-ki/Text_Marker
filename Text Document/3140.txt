The one place in the world that would like to visit is France. I wanted to visit France because French was my favorite language and when I watch TV some TV shows brings up some staff members about France and the French people and if I wanted to visit France I would want to know staff about them. That is why I would like to visit France. If I visit France what I would like to visit and see is the museum that they have. I know that France have the biggest museum in the world it has everything about all the history of all the countries. I would also like to visit the tower that they have in Generic_City I wanted to visit the tower because its really high, and it looks cool to me. What want to find out is about what people do on holidays such as Christmas, what they eat and about their education. These are the things I would like to see and visit. This is why I want to visit France and what I want to see and do when if I visit France.
