Have you ever wondered what it is like to have a homework club at your school, well It's pretty useful. The idea is for kids to do their homework at school instead of at home, you can get help from a teacher and also work with your buddies. One reason why I argue for school clubs to be available is because you it gives you time to do other stuff such as, spending time with your family, spending time with your friends, and even go to the movies. If you do your homework at the homework club you won't have to worry about due dates, quizzes, or tests. If you don't go the homework club you will always have tons of homework and not even do it which can cause your grades to fall down and probably not graduate if the required skills aren't meet. Secondly, if you and your friend are in the same class and get the same homework then you can work on it together, check each other's papers, and quiz each other on it. If you work on it alone you might get confused and frustrated, or maybe stressed, obviously copying one another does not make you learn anything, but there is a teacher who can help both of you at the same time. Video games are very fun and addictive, but you can't play if you got homework in the way. If you get your homework done then you have the whole day to play with your friends, communicate with them and even battle to the lat one standing. Some video games have blood, gore, and violence and some kids love those games which can be a small problem but not a big one, most parents can take devices and electronics away because kids don't do their homework so if you want to play video games and have fun you better go to homework club. In conclusion the homework club should be available and going so that kids can finish their homework all at once and have fun in and out of school. Homework is really important and kids very often don't do their homework and that's probably the reason why kids hate school and do not want to get to school.
