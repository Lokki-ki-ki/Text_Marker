Where is one place I would visit ? I would like to visits pain! Because I heard that Spain has "good soccer teams". But the reason i'll want to visit Spain is if I do good in soccer I can have a chance to become professional and have a lot of money and help my parents. Also, because there's nice places you can visit like beaches, soccer stadiums, soccer team, professional soccer players mostly everything fun at Spain. Spain has every nice weather and if i listed Spain I would go to the beach, and go see soccer teams. I want to go to Spain to see Messi, Ronaldo, Neymar or get my shoes or shirt signed by one of them. If I went to Spain the "first" thing i'll visit is this one places were a soccer player grew up at. The reason I would visit it is because I wanted to see how he grew up like and how it was like. I also want to feel how it felt to live like they did. Imagen being been somebody lived at it would be really cool you can take pictures, maybe meet there friends, or uncles, maybe there could visit were they used to live at and give you a hug, or something. I image me, and my parents going to watch a soccer game together, going to TH beaches. I'll like to go to Spain just to play soccer with Messi, or any Professional Soccer player. If I went to Spain I would love to train with a professional soccer club. Spain would give u a chance to become a good soccer player that all I want. Mostly everyone became rich at Spain. I feel like Spain would make a better soccer player i'll have better training, food,house and you'll meet new people, friends, and most likely to speak another language.
