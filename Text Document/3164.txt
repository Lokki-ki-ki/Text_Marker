I disagree with the school bored adding one and a half hour to school each day. Because students will have to wake up very early every day and get out from school late that's messed up to do to us like every class will be like more than a 1 hour and 30 minutes of class time hell no. I will die having a class like that but. I hope we have gym for 2 hours and 30 minutes every day that will be fun but without having health and I will be so happy if we never have 5 sols every year like 2 or 3 is fine but 5 noes that's too many sols for 1 year like the county is so mean to us, but it's all good and having recess like what I had when I was a little boy. I think when I get older I want to be a soccer player or a basketball player, but I do not know yet like when my dad was a little boy he was poor, and he wants to be a soccer player, but his dream never became true but when he came to the United States he went to her don high school for 2 or 3 year and then he learned how to speck English and got to play for the schools' soccer team. I think school is not that hard but for some people it is but the hardest class for me is Math history that all the class that I hard for me the other class are not that hard for me..........
