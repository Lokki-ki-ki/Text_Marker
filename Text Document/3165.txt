The famous Albert Einstein always said "Imagination is more important than knowledge". I agree with this amazing quote because without imagination you wouldn't be yourself. As a kid everyone has always imagined of them being like or better than someone. These are my reasons of why I agree with the famous Albert Einstein.First, without an imagination you wouldn't have dreams to succeed. Myself for example I've always wanted to be a professional soccer player. But than I realized that soccer isn't very popular in America. So than I started playing football and I enjoy playing that sport very much. Since then I've always imagined of being a professional football player. Secondly, imagination is an everyday thing you use it every day in many ways. Imagination is like an opinion, no one can take that from you. It can be positive nor negative either way no one can change the way you think. Imagination is everything because you always imagine or wish you were doing something or wish you were with someone. As a person that has dreams to succeed you need imagination to achieve them. As one can see, me as a football player. I use my imagination a lot for many reasons. Because I am very competitive when it comes to sports, I always want to be better than the old me. I always want to be one step ahead from everyone. For that reason I think I use my imagination a lot. Like if I ever lose at something I would think about it and say "imagine if I won". Lastly, the famous quote can say a lot in my opinion. Because without an imagination you wouldn't be a regular person.
