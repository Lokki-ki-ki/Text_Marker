Think about the benefits of working with a group or working alone. Which do I feel is more beneficial? Well working alone get you more focus and not playing around. If working with a group it will be different from working alone, because you can work faster or get the answer of them and be a great group to past the class and work on it but working together as a group it will be hard not you not gonna focus too because they going to be playing around and not pay attention to what the teacher is saying in class. Some people wanna work alone or work as group and the reason why people want to do that because working long they can focus and not play around, and working as a group people are gonna work together just to play around and not be paying any attention just being in the phone or talking. Teachers need to do something about working together as a group because they just going to goof around and not do there work they just going to be talking and being on their phone. I feel like people need to work alone, so they can focus on there work and be paying attention to the teachers and do there work. I don't think people should work as a group. At the same time people should work as a group because they can help each other and give answer to each other
