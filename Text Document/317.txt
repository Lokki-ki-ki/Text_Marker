Attend classes from home by way of online can be a good idea but, in my position is not a good way for the student and can be unnecessary or bad idea in many reasons. When the student is in home he's going to do what he wants he doesn't care the class he's going to feel like if he doesn't have to do have to work in that class, and he doesn't thing if he's going to lose the class, one example is one of my friends he has an line class but when he is in home he don't work because he don't care because no have one teacher who says "Work or you no going to pass the class" and that's one reason. My second reason is when the student is taken online classes he's just going to finish, he no going to learn because he don't care learn he's just going to complete the seasons but just that, why? Because he don't have the teacher who explain when he has questions or when he is interested in something of the class he doesn't have the teacher who know more about that. Some people say when the student takes the online class from home he is more concentrate however when the student take this classes from home he is more distracted because he has the cellphone in his hand, or he has the TV in the room, the dog, the play station and he's going to prefer play or see movies than work on the classes. In conclusion the student can not work, no have the teacher for question or warn he can lost the class or are more distraction or prefer play than work on the class are my reasons for no take online classes but with the good students can be a good idea.
