Thomas Jefferson wrote Determine never to be idle. It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing. I agree that we accomplish more if we are always doing something right or important, however, that it doesn't mean that you are idle. While, if we are working or study. They are many people that works on important jobs, sometime they suggest you to have a lot of energy and be prepared. For example on the job a lot of employees that against you because they said that you are idle, and you don't want to do nothing. Instead that the employees at your job don't know that you are tired because you have two jobs. Some people, students or parents lived so tire, and they look idle. At my house we live all together and sometimes i don't to do nothing at my house. My parents argument me that i don't clean the house. For example that i don't study or help my mom with my little brother. In addition, my family doesn't know that I have two jobs because I want to help her to play the rent of the house, that why some people look idle or tired. They are some friends that they teach you, and they support you to be a better person with good behavior those people want you to be how great you are doing something productive. Needles, some friends want you to be like them with bad reputation. For example unemployment, without money, you need to be responsibility of your acts. In conclusion, it doesn't matter if other people are telling you idle or unemployment, they are time that it is hard to find a job, or you just want to rest because you are tire, it is wonderful to know that how much may be done if are always doing something;Therefore, some people think that does inactivity also serve a purpose. In my opinion they should be doing something at life to receive a good purpose in your life.
