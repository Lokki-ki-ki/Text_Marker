My opinion about If school students have to a four-day school week. The students and teachers can get a more free DAR, that day we can take sleep, study for other you need study something, enjoy with your family, develop your self and what do I want to do. I can have many good something for you. But the other days, you have the school day two more hours. You need to think about now. We have seven hours on school, you dose not tired for long times in school? The seven hour is very long time, every early morning all students wake up the May de am 5:30 or 6:00, you need take prepare to go to school, and stay there for seven hours. But if we have a four-day school week and expending the school day two hours, you should lose the two hours from much something. For example, I can't have a sleep, study for you need to know something, enjoy with my family, develop my self, and what do I want to do. Because we have a four-day school week and expending the school day two hours. If we have two more hours in school, we need stay two more hours in school, more study. I don't want to losing my five day's happy and free. We need more think about what is perfect for us.
