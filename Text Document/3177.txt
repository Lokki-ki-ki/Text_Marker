I disagree that the school bored planes to add one and a half hours of school each day, because student need to have a period of time that they can stay at school that they can get home on time. I want the school bored to take fewer hours off of school for students because they can hang out with family and friends after school at the regular time every day.First, students learn so much everyday that they get so tired and frustrated. Also, the student don't want the school bored to extend time for one and half hours to the regular school time because they have carfare. Second of all, there family probable wonder where there son/daughter are at, that's why we don't want to extend the time. If the school bored extend more time there would be more homework and the students won't like that there would be homework involved. Third of all, the teacher probable don't want to stay at school for just an hour an half. The teachers don't want the school bored to extend more school time because they probably are tired to teach so many students every day of the week. As you can see, the school bored shouldn't extend more time to school for students because we don't want to stay after school for more learning.
