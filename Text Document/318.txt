I disagree with this statement because your first impressions of someone or something can change overtime. When you first meet someone you automatically get an impression of that person from the way they dress, or the way they speak basically the way they do things.Nowadays people jump into conclusions, they never met the person, they just go off upon looks. For example say a teenager is wearing all black with ripped jeans, and they got their pants down low, adults are going to think that teen is possible a gangster or a thug but that's not the case, that's just the style nowadays. First impression can change overtime, once you get used to something your mindset changes, say you meet a friend and you guys start talking, and your friends starts giving you an attitude, you're going to assume that your friend doesn't like you, so you keep that mindset. Y'all start talking again and this time it's going way better, you and your friend are laughing, overall just having a good time now your opinion has changed towards the person. There was this guy he started to stare at me every few seconds so I thought he had a problem or something, but he looked familiar but I couldn't figure out where I've seen him from, later that day he ended up being in my last block class, the teacher made the class work in pairs so I got up and asked the guy if he wanted to be my partner, he said sure, and we began working, we started talking about random things until he said "you look familiar" then he said didn't we go to the same middle school together, then it clicked I was friends with this guy back in middle school and haven't seen him in a long time, after that day we began talking almost every day. The first impressions aren't always impossible to change, you learn to change your mind overtime and start accepting things for what it is.
