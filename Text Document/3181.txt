Ralph Waldo Emerson says"unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow." On one hand, some people disagree with statement. On the other hand, some people agree with this statement. People should try to do something beyond what they have already mastered since their confident level will grow, it makes them feel good, and make their live easier. However, not everybody agrees with position, some people claim that people can grow in live without trying something new because they don't want to get out of their comfort zone and try new things. Nevertheless, this opposition other important, namely that trying new things give us a high level of confident. For example, my biggest fear in live is airplanes and I have never been on it, but if I try it for the first time in my live even I scare or not next time, i would have more confident for trying new thing since when the airplane was my biggest fear and I try it. I could do more. Furthermore, trying new things make our confident level high which is an important thing in our live. In addition, it makes us feel good. For instance, my cousin was always sad, and she hated to try new things. One day we went swimming, everyone had fun except my cousin. After condensing her for a long time, she tries it. On that time, my cousin was so happy that she even wants to be a swimmer now. Thus, people should try new things to make them feel good and happy. Finally, it makes the live easy. To illustrate, if someone is so strike in live and doesn't want to try something beyond what he/she already mastered, that person will have a hard live. The person will never grow in live since he/she scares to get out the comfort zone and try new thing. Moreover, we should get out of our comfort zone, so we could have an easy live. Based on this argument, one must conclude, people never get better unless they try new things in live. In the whole, Ralph Waldo Emerson's statement was true based of the reasons.
