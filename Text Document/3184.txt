An old adverb can hurt someone no matter if it's through songs, books or movies. It can hurt us in any way and the adverbs matter a lot of your typing and use the wrong verb. It can bring down your grade, but you can practice every day to get better at writing and know your verbs. Depending on the verb if its right or wrong if its wrong your grade goes down lets say if you have a 96 on a test and the verb is bad. It will go down to a 94 if its more than the lower your grade goes and if its right you have no problems with typing. A correct promotion can even miss a verb if your not careful enough. Anything can hurt your grade by being small things to big things including miss spelling. Bad verbs can be everywhere including movies and books to scripts that's why people have to be extra careful typing. Spelling. Reading and pronouncing a word. That's why you have to be extra careful and read the sentence over and over again till you know it's correct and to see if it's all good. If you do it good enough you might be looking at a grade that's would be higher than a c but if you don't at least a c or a d and it couldn't be bad. But your grade means anything more in school, and you should take good care of it to. If you want to keep making your parents proud and get rewards too. So that's the good thing about it to keep a higher grade
