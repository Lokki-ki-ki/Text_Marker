In this quote that Albert Schweitzer wrote said "Example is not the main thing influencing others; it is the only thing." There are many ways to influence other. For example talk to them about your experience. Although some say that should not influence other people about own behavior because people will get mad, actually some say there should be own behavior is the way to influence others because you can have more friend and be a good person. In my opinion, the best way to influence other is talk softly and calm because they can understand more. For example if you scream every day to them, they will not respect you and then will not care anymore. They will be doing the same to other person. Other Person when they talk about they own behavior they get mad because they know what they are doing something bad they get nervous. Second they have to be brave to talk about to the doctor, for example if you kill somebody, and you don't know what to do, and you have bad attitude than you have to go to talk with somebody you trust, you have to be brave. But as you can see there are many ways to influence other and had talk to them, they will have good education.
