"Does true self-esteem comes from praise or does it come from achievement." Self-esteem comes from achievement because it makes you feel good. It makes you feel that you could do anything. Also, you can learn not to give up. Self-esteem comes from achieving, it will make you feel good about yourself. For example, if Generic_Name achieves shooting five times at the three point line and makes all of them; he will feel good about himself. His self-esteem is feeling good, so he may try to do more next time at the three point line. But feeling good about yourself is not the only thing that will help with your self-esteem. Another is it will make you feel that you could do anything. For example, if Generic_Name wins the art fair only in her class, but the school is having an art fair for the whole sophomore class. Her self-esteem will kick in, and she may sign also you can learn how to not give up for example if Generic_Name lose the class discussion, but the class is going to have another one the next day she is going to try her hardest to win the next class discussion. I think that achievement will help kids with their learning because nowadays, kids like winning and winning things at the end it makes their self-esteem built up.
