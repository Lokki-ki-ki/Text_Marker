I agree with this statement, first impressions with people or places are difficult to change. But first the definition of Impression is a lasting effect, opinion, or mental image. Is a belief of understanding of sth. Here is an example in a sentence, I made a bad impression by arriving late for the interview. I always see the bad and good things in each person and in each place too. But sometimes the impressions can change, It depends on the person. Now I'm going to make some examples about the first impressions in people and with places. For example, If I'm going to a restaurant the first impressions that I'm looking for, are If the local is cleanly(floor, chairs, etc.), the bathroom they aren't dirty, the employers(making sure that they are using gloves when they touch the food and when they prepare the food, Plague(rats, cockroach, etc.) that's very important because we don't want to get transmit a bacteria or something like that). Another example, If I'm going to a friend house, my first impressions that I'm looking for, are typically the same of the restaurant, instead of the part of the employs(obviously), but if the house is dirty, for example: (the floor, the kitchen, the bathroom, etc...) that impressions can change for me, because they probably clean the house every day, but just that day they don't clean it. And now I'm going to make some example of first impressions for a person, the first impression that I saw in a person is the personality(vibes, etc.), the education level(respectful, responsible, etc.), the way of she/he dress it(outfits) that's when the phrase "dress to impress" takes place, if the person is comic, etc. Some people do the same, but some person just talk in the bad way of other persons, and sometimes they don't know them, they don't talk to them, and that's too bad impression for the person that is doing that, they are wrong :/So my point, is I just said before, the impressions can change, and it depends on the person.
