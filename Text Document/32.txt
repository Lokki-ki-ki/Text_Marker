Some people may think that positive attitude is not the key to success in life, but I disagree with them because I feel like now days are not the same as it used to be, and I think it's a big issue that we have today in our world. People just want to finish their jobs very fast, and they want to get where their going really fast, and that leads to not have a good attitude with others, one of the first reasons is you can get to your dream job, for example if your positive with others they can like you or offer you a deal that's going to change your life forever, and they may say that you a great person, and they might offer you to come and work in their company or work in a really great passion. Another reason is you can make someone's day or make them happy, for example their having a awful day, and you come and talk to them with a positive attitude, and maybe you're going to make them really happy and also that can effect on others if you make them happy they can make others people happy also. One last reason is Communication, for example by having a positive attitude you can communicate with others, and you can have a good relationship with them and maybe be perfect friends. In conclusion for all these reasons I think positive attitude is the key to your success.
