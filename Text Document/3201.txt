First impressions are almost impossible to change. Yes, I agree based on my own experience for me first impression is important. Because of how I see someone and feel someone by their energy. For example, I met my best friend other friend, the first time I saw her other friend I instantly like her. She was so sweet always giving me a good energy that I want for a person. She was so kind and love to smile, and she dress neatly. Her smile effect me she makes want to me smile, from that moment on I know that her and I could get a long. Another example my seatmate, my first impression about him was a good one. Because he was just calm and his attitude is the same as mine. I see myself in him, him and I just get along well and his giving a good energy that I like for a person. Another example first day of our club meeting, my club teacher paired me to someone that I don't know, For us to know who are other club members are to know each other. My first impression about her was not good, because she did not talk to me when I tried to talk to her. She gives me a bad energy that I don't like to a person. Some people might disagree with me that first impressions are almost impossible to change, and some people might agree with me. I agree, because first impression are important to me, it helps me to know instantly if I like the person that I just met or not. Some people might say or think that first impression does not matter, because you should know the person you just met more. Before you decide that when ever you like that person or not. And I would agree to that, but for me first impression are almost impossible to change, for my own opinion.
