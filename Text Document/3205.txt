Hey have you been asked to teach a group of elementary students a lesson? Well you have been chosen to teach a group of students a lesson and the lesson was multiplying and dividing because it will teach how add and subtract quickly. The 1st example is like going to a grocery store and don't know how much does 4 bags of chips cost for the party you're going to well multiplying can help you figure out the cost. The 2nd example for dividing can help you figure out if you have a discount you can find the new cost and how much money you saved. Final reason is like multiplying and dividing fractions like 1/2 times 2/3 that would equal 2/6 and dividing that by 1/2 will equal 2/3 because if you add that is would be 3/5 and subtracting that by 1/3 would be 2/2 which is 1. So in conclusion multiplying and dividing can help you get answer more fast than adding and subtracting over and over.
