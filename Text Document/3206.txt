I disagree with schools having a program with older and youngest studentsMany younger students does not know anything about programming older students are the smartest then the youngest studentsMany the youngest students are not smarter than the older students1. One day when I was on elementary school I was in 4th grade and my teacher put me on a program with older people and the older people were smarter than me and I didn't knew anything and the older people knew everything I was the only one who dint knew anything.2. The other day I was on middle school and I was on a program and I was on 8th grade and I was in a program with the youngest students the youngest students weren't smartest than the older student and there was a kid who dint knew anything on the program.3. The last thing when I was I high school I was in 10th grade and I went to a program with young students and I was smarter than younger students and my teacher was proud of the older students.
