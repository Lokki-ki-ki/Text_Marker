I disagree with the school board because we not trying to be in school more time in school. Also, students need to have their own time outside of school with family and friends. I also think this because students spent 8hrs in school more than what they spend at home. My other idea is that I think the schools around that county should have an essay in all schools asking students about how they feel about this decision. The county should take the students decision as an answer about what they think because our ideas matter too. Also, the school should be thinking about the students benefits of being in school for longer and for less not just to one side. I think if they did that they point of view will change a lot of knowing what students think also it would help them know about what students they are dealing with that would be a great advantage for them. That would help them with the decision and knowing what would be the impact on the students. This is my prompt to y'all about if I agree or disagree.
