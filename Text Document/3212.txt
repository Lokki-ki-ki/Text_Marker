I'm an 8th grader and would like to shared something's the would like to accomplish in the future. My firs' thing the would like to accomplish in the future is to graduate from High school and Collage because many benefits if you graduated from from High school and Collage you can have a better job like being a nurse and a lawyer and many diff rents types of jobs, and you can be a professional worker. But you have to work hard a school don't get in trouble at school and not have a bad record, so you can accomplish to graduated from High school and Collage. In my opinion is worth it be in school for seven hours to pay attention in school because it will help a lot in your future. The second thing I would like to accomplish is to learn French because that's one of the language I'm interested on because I like French culture and I feel that French is an easy language to learn because it's similar to Spanish and I would like to have the opportunity to know three languages (Spanish, Inglesh and, French) and if you know more than one language you can help another people at school, and you can also get paid more on your Job. The third thing the really want to accomplish is to help my parents when I'm older I really want to do this have been with me all the time, they are being such a good parents I know the probably won't need my help, but I really want to accomplish this goal for many other reasons one of them is because this is coming out of my heart. I ask god to let give them the opportunity to see me and my brother grow and make them proud once again. The last thing the would to accomplish is to help the shelters where all the immigrant people are because they are looking for a better future for there family because sometimes there life is in risk and they don't want there family lives in risk so that's why they risk their lives to come to this country.
