It wouldn't even matter if the school lunch changes to healthy food. Even until this day they still don't change to a deathly choice. Student has tried to make the school lunch meals change, but there wasn't any difference. Sometimes the students doesn't make good healthy food choice there will be times that the lunch menu will have healthy choices and not so deathly choices. For example: the lunches gives us two options one is pizza and the other rice with chicken, students will definitely go for pizza. It would be a good idea that the school lunches menu changes to a healthy menu. We do need to consider other students and their eating habits, most students doesn't even eat, they even go a whole day without eating. If the school were to change the unhealthy food they should get rid of pizza, hot dogs, and chicken nuggets and make up for potatoes with rice and chicken, a nice pasta salad with tomatoes, onions, and, spinach. Some students are vegan, so maybe they can have a veggie burger anything with veggies. If that's the case to change school lunch menu, the school should consider how and where they should spend money on things like changing the floor tiles its unnecessary it could have been for something better. No one really cares about how bad the school lunch is, it's not the worst thing in the world. Anyway that's why us students have to be smart and bring our own food to school like most of them do. In reality, it really doesn't matter because students still eat school food, some students do complain about how nasty the food is, but they still won't bring their own food how logical is that. To be honest there are sometimes good lunches like we said before it's not the best thing in the world. So its okay don't waste on changing something when you knew it could have been done from the start. Just bring your own food from home, and you won't have worry about the school menu.
