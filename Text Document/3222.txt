Should young students commit to a career. I think young students should not commit to a career yet because their minds can change at any moment and if they commit to a career and if they start to not like the career they wanted they will waste all their time and effect to that one career. Also, If the class's for the career are difficult they and they give up halfway and drop out the class and never try again. So their goal to get the career they want is not in reach for them anymore. Also, you may still not be ready to commit to a career because there are different things you may be into and like doing more than the job you want to do. However, some people may not feel the same way as me on this topic. People may think that is a good idea that young student commit to a career because they have an idea of what they want to do later in life and won't be stuck as may other students may be. I still think at students that are young should not commit to a career yet. So For my conclusion if you are in high school and if you don't know if you want to commit to a specific career don't because you can change your mind at anytime. Also, you may not like the career you look into or may find it hard and give up and that's not a good thing to do.
