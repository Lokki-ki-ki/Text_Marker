Dear principal think some student want to go help the community and some of them didn't want to help the community but I think that student should perform community service because we not let down the student who wants to go and help the community because if u say the student will not perform community some student will think that this is unfair, and they will not agree with this decision. All I have to say is that student should perform community. Have a great decision and also, thank you.
