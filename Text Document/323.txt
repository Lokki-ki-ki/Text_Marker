I agree to the quote"Success consist of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm." In our life, in order to get what we desire is to overcome failures. It teaches us to become stronger and to keep going without losing faith in pursuing our goals until we succeed. Based on my experience, doing what I love is the most important thing. No matter how many times I fail; as long as I love it, I will keep going to reach my goal. I will not mind other people, even they're telling me to stop and give up. For me, failing is the way that life gives to be stronger. Some people might think that life is very unfair, it just depends on how strong a person is to rise up after every fall. Every individual should have faith, in order to conquer challenges. Failing is just a word, it can't do anything to stop a person to keep trying to pursue its goals. Failing for me doesn't mean it's the end. It's a good experience, because it teaches lessons. Doing what I love motivates me more not to give up, instead I'll keep standing up after I fail in order to succeed. In life, trying is not bad. Having faith and being enthusiastic is needed to overpass all obstacles by not giving up after failing. Keep trying to get what we want.
