Author Ralph Waldo Emerson, has kind of a point about the world trying to make you something else. My point of view is that we all have choice's we make to better our selves to make us better people in the world but some of the choices we make as human's can lead us to a wrong path. We as people have to set goal's for the future and plan ahead to accomplish them. One thing I learn while being incarcerated you got to value yourself more than you value other's, if you don't value yourself what's the point for setting up goal's if all they're going to do is collect dust. Everybody haves different opinion's some people might think the world is at fault for the choices they make and that's not true, people blame others when they know their in the wrong or done something wrong than try to say it's the other person's fault. I'll say is, with everything going on in the world we got to get together and help each other more and come together as a team NO! More as a family, when one of us fall down we lift each other up, if one of us gets hurt we heal each other. There's got to be thing's we can do, hard time's don't last forever at these moments we got to remember how far we come from hard time's when things didn't look good for us. The world can try to charge you, it can try to break you, it can throw you to the side but the goals you set up and the people by your side will help you complete the dream's and goal's you wish about.
