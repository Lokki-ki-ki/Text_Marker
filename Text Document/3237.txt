Have you ever hurt someone feel before? There are some people want to be honest to their friends or family, but there is other people don't want to be honest because there are sacred it might hurt them. People don't want to be honest to their friend because they might lose there friendship forever. Will I disagree for being honest at all time? You don't have to be honest all the time it might hurt them, but they need to know the truth. For the person who have to tell them the truth is hard for them because they don't know it might hurt there feels or might lose there friendship and maybe not forgive them. Maybe there will be a point you have to tell the true to your friends and maybe there will not be a point to tall the true to them but sometimes you have to honest. There will be a point that you have to tell the true like how you feel about them or what you don't like them if you don't like about them tell them the true be honest to them and if they don't want to be your friends so don't be then. There are some friends don't like to hear the true from others. There are others do like to hear the true from other, so they can be a good friend or a person. So you can trust them and feel like they are you friends but a good and a very fun friend you ever want to have and dream of having. If you can't be honest to your friends don't said anything just be quit but just let you know there will be time you have to be honest, but you don't be honest every time you can say the truth. Be honesty sometime you can think about before you do it but think about good sometime be honest doesn't go will as you plane it. It can go bad but very bad but something it does go good.
