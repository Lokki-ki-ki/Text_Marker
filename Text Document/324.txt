Do you wish to have healthier school lunch menu?. Imagine your school cafeteria plans to change to a new, healthier school lunch menu, which would eliminate some students' favorite cafeteria foods. Many students wouldn't want to eliminate some of their favorite cafeteria foods. Therefore, I believe healthier school lunch menu you could benefit students at school, at work, and at home. Dear, Dr. Generic_Namely name is Generic_Name, I am a freshman at Generic_School. I would like to talk to you about a healthier school lunch menu. Ever since these 4 months have passed I've been eating the school lunch. Every time I eat the school lunch, after 30 minutes I would go to the restroom. The food wouldn't sit right nor feel right in my stomach. The issue isn't just with me, my friend Generic_Name has an allergic reaction whenever he eats something from the school lunch menu. I believe it would be a good idea to have healthier school lunch menu. Because half of our students at Generic_School are obese. Even you know all the food you're providing for us is junk food. The pasta has puddles of oil, the burgers don't taste like real meat, the orange chicken isn't even cooked well. All the food you are providing for us is microwaved food. Instead of all these microwaved food. We could have similar foods as the ones we have right now for the lunch menu. The foods you feed us should be organic like the bread, meat, spaghetti, etc. The school lunch should be worth $3.75. Dr. Generic_Name instead of thinking about yourself think about us a little more. Imagine yourself sitting down at the lunch table seeing a puddle of oil on your pasta tray. Imagine eating rock hard french fries. Please think about it and call me into your office if you ever want to talk about this issue that 75% of the students are having here at Generic_School. Sincerely, Generic_Name
