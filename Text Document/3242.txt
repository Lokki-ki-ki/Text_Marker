Author Ralph Waldo Emerson Wrote,"Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow." I disagree with The Author Ralph Waldo Emerson because if you have already tried to do something more than you have already mastered, You will grow because now days there is too much competition in everything for examples Companies, Schools and Sports etc. I think if you try to do something more than you have mastered will make you better than you are because if you have mastered in something it will not be a bad idea to practice more even you know everything because everyday somebody is getting good by watching people those have mastered everything so when they go against them, they will beat the master because they already know what's the master is going to do, and they will try to protect themselves. Here are some examples when people play video games like Fortnite people be watching streamers from YouTube and twitch to get better and learn some new moves and after watching them for some weeks they know what they are going to do next and how they're going to play at any bad or good situational are some example like Apple is big company and Samsung is a big company they both have some bad relationships like Apple always make a good phone which is always better than Samsung, but Samsung try their best to make a better phone than Apple so, Samsung has been trying to make better phones then Apple by trying to copy their features for examples the screen size, The GB, and motherboards. Only reason Apple is making better phones because they have mastered everything, and they are still making some new technology which Samsung might not able to make in next two or three years and here is an another example they are so many cars in the world for example Mercedes and Lamborghini they both are good cars Mercedes is an old company, so they know everything about the car the way the want to make it luxury or fast and for example Mercedes is a fast and a luxury car where Lamborghini is a fast and luxury car, Here is a last example like your coach if you play sports you need a coach which is going to teach you how to play and teach some moves that you can use to beat your enemy and make you strong and tell how to dodge some stuff when they try to hit you for example people play boxing and for new people they hire coaches which help them to learn how to play and stuff. And teach you how to defend your self from getting hit on your face or hitting him back. The conclusion is yes, I disagreed withTheAuthor Ralph Waldo Emerson Wrote,"Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow." and you need to practice every day don't matter how good your there is a lot of completion out there and some people don't even know there are so many people better than them which some people don't even know what kind of abilities they got. They need to go to gym and stuff to know hat kind of abilities they better in a moth year or days. And to get their mind working antler and help them to have a good mind and learn how to grow better and teach you guys to learn and thank-you for grading my essay I love you from heart and have a nice day. At the end of the day the light away the light
