Energy and resources, are one of the most very important things in the world. So we should all try to save it. If we waste both of them we can't live without it. This is why most the countries doesn't have one them or both, because they spent more money on, doing other stuff like main new buildings, restaurants etc. Instead of that, we should be saving money on resources, so people can eat and save energy by turning most of the lights of just need to turn main lights on, because in today's world companies make money of the people, by sending them extra bills even though they didn't use that much energy. Schools are one of the most places to waste more energy. It could change, if we have less school hours we could save energy. In my school I mostly see all the lights are on, if there is no class the lights should be turned off, this is one of the big reason. In most of my classes the lights are turned off, because we care about our school. My school mostly have all the resources, but we need to have more because more students are coming in from other countries. We should be taking care of our school, have it clean and don't waste.
