Think high school offer those programs to young students that wants to graduate in early age and other students take this programs, because they want to graduate to continue with college or work to help their families. In other cases students just took these courses because they don't like school. But however there are always students that decide to complete high school in four years to have full credits to go at the best colleges. These students that take high school in four years are more prepared to colleges, and they have more probabilities to get a better job. For me take school in three years is a bad choice, because you learn a few less. Examples:If you take school in three years and if you don't have the result that you wanted than you are going to think that was a bad choice in your life. Conclusion: students would take the traditional four years of school and enjoy the young age at school. Then after the four regular years, It's time to think about what they want to do with life work or continue with college.
