Have you ever ask yourself why do some people are always are their home never go out to socialize with others? Since technology appear in the world, the life of millions of people got an easier way to live, because it brought most of the things and supplies that we need to make our life better and easier. In my opinion I think technology has positive effect in people's live specially in young people, because teens who are in school have more opportunities to learn a get the skills that they need for their future, they have access to computers at their school to get more information about their classwork and the benefit to take classes or tests online without even attending to school. Technology allows you to communicate with others without having contact, you don't need to be face to communicate with others, it brings people the facilities for those who don't have time to go out to buy the things that they need online like clothes or grocery without going to the store, and the capability to invent things that humans can't do.However, technology has negatives effects too, have you ever seen a little kid playing with toys like before technology was invented, you can see kids of 5-10 years old that already have a phone or video game console, they are addicted to it but not only kids young people too, therefore people can lose their vision by using it too much but it's not the fault of technology it's our own responsibility to take care of our health. Technology affects peoples life by reducing their contact with others but at the same time it brings a lot of benefits to our generation and the future.
