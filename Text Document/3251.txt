Yesterday, I was talking with my parents, and they tell me that I have to start thinking about what career I want after I graduate from high school. I start seeing what issues can cause, and I think that it is bad idea to select what career I want at this age, because what's is going to happen if I don't like the career that I choose when I was younger or if that career is going to give me the money that I'm looking for and what about if my parents are not in conditions to help me pay the career that I want, after think all this I meet with my parents again, and I tell them the reasons that why I don't want to select my career at this time. The first reason that I think why is not a good idea to select my career at this age was, what is going to happen if I select one career but after four or five years later I like other career and I really want to be in the other that it's totally different from the one that I select five years before, maybe they are going to get mad at me because they are going to say that am just wasting my time or something like that, and I don't want me to want to be sure about the career that I get is going to really like me when I get older. The second reason was, who knows that is that career is going to help me in my economy because some career with the time they lose demand on the thing that they are doing, and they give you fire or reduce your salary, but if I take my time to think and analyze all the careers that I like that can be better, because everyone wants a job that can provide a good salary and a good benefits and that's what I want, in that way everything is going to be more secure for me that nothing of that issues that I said before is going to happen, and my economy stays in good conditions. And the third reason that I think was, what about if I select my career and my parents after the four years that we have to do in high school they don't have the opportunity to help me pay my career and I ready get very excited that is going to get me very nervous because I didn't think about what other career I want to do. This is why I want more time to think about it and see if my parents can help me to pay the career that I choose, in this way me and my parents don't get frustrated, I for having multiple choices of what careers I like and my parents for paying something that they can afford with their money. In conclusion, I think that it is a awful idea to let young kids decide what career they want because not all the time it is going to like the same career that we choose when we were younger or what about if after high school you decide to no continued in school because you have to work because your parents need help for paying some stuffs or because you want to buy your own things or just you don't like school anymore, so in my opinion I think it's very important to have a lot of time for choose whatever you want to do after you graduate from high school.
