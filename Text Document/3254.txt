Some people believe that true self-esteem come from achievement, Think that they are wrong, I think that self-esteem come from praising student. People that believe that true self-esteem come from praising student work are thought that they are right. Like for example;if the student want to learn and they are trying to do what you ask that to do, and they died not do it the right way, and you tell than that is not bad, and you keep encouraging than to keep trying, it will give than the confident to do more work because they know that they are doing something good, but if they are working hard, and you keep telling than that they are due or telling than that they are not doing it the right way they will get tire and will not have the energy to work anymore. People that pries student are people who want to show the student that they can do anything that they want to do in life, I believe that many students will be able to do well in school if only the teacher can make than to know that they are spinal like every one of the student in the class or school, there are many students out there that want to learn, but they just need someone who will be able to encourage than that they should trust in that self and tell than that they can do it.
