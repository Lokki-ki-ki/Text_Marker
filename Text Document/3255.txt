Something I'd like to accomplish in the future would be to practice my singing because it makes me happy, it can turn into fun and games with your friends, it helps relieve my stress, and you can freestyle when you sing. Lastly, I think that singing is very fun and helpful. Singing makes me happy because whenever I'm done singing a song it makes me smile. Once I'm done singing a song I'll have the urge to sing more because I love to sing. Ever since I was a little girl I would occasionally ask my dad to sing to me and ever since then I've always been passionate about singing. I sing whenever I'm sad, and then I choose a song, and I'll sing to the song I chose, and it'll make me happy. Me and my best friend play around a lot and when we do, we'll start singing but in a fun way. We'll be so off-key. And start goofing around. We'll do singing contests. This one time we did a singing contest that went on for hours, and it turned out to be a tie. So we did a rematch, and she won that rematch. So we had another one then I won. Singing has been helping me relieve my stress a lot lately. Because since Sols are like right around the corner I've been singing to just get my mind off everything that's stressful. I felt relieved to sing because I hadn't sung in quite a while. I also felt very happy to sing, after singing I was energetic. In conclusion, I think that singing is very fun and helpful, and it can also get your mind off anything that bothers you.
