"Determine never to be idle. It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing" this is what Thomas Jefferson wrote, and I am totally agreed with him some peoples always are saying they can finish nothing but is because that never doing that, never try very hard they want to stay doing nothing all the time and that's why but when you are always doing something you finish too much like when you are doing a report work on that, and you finish and after that you can do something more and then something more and more and more, but you can be finished because you are doing that you no just finish your report and stop and say "ok I finish this now I can go to relax all my life" new you work and work and for that you receive one recompense yo don't work for nothing. And if Thomas Jefferson says that is because is true he always do something and he's done many things he be never idle, and you never had to be idle too, and I think his main idea is to persuade the people to do something all the time because when people dew the world change.
