Should students be required to take a class in the arts, or should such classes be electives?everybody knows that, that kind of classes could be funny, but what happen with those guys that does not feel interest with the class? It is a wasted of time, we could use that time in another class, where they feel comfortable, where they feel interest about the class, you can not be good in something if it does not like you, the classes must improve our skills, that's the reason why I believe that classes should be electives; on that way, I have the option, TP select my class, for example: art, music, chorus, drama, etc. Why? Simple, not everybody has the same capacity, as somebody said "we can not judge a fish by his ability to claim a tree", we must motive the student to take the class that he/she wants, and they will give their best. Thanks for the attention, in addition, I hope that the principal could take a smart choice and leave the classes electives.
