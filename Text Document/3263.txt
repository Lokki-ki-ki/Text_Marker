The idea of creating a new menu for the cafeteria affects people who are trying to have a healthier diet, and kids who need to be clean of bad supplements for the sports season. Otherwise, Students that come to our school since freshman year love the traditional food of the cafeteria. It is a good idea to include the new recipe of food in the cafeteria menu because, it will have more types of vitamins, proteins, and all type of good supplements that a young health body needs. Also, Teachers agree that would be a good upgrade for the students to have an extra meal that is healthier, and it is in a good quantity. If the changing in our menu happens, the students that do sports will have a second meal to support all the exercise that is needed for the soccer teams, football, etc... In some others' opinion, the new menu in the cafeteria will affect the business in our school, because the students that are in the school for a longer time will not like to change their favorite types of food. Some students might not agree with the changing of the recipe in the cafeteria, but for those reasons, the principal and teachers agree that the new menu would be a healthier and more elaborated meal for everyone in our school.
