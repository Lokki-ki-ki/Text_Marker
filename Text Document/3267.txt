I think, first impressions are more effected than other events. Because first reactions are usually hectic. We will not know until we feel something. Somehow, recollections can give you positive or negative effects. If a person had a bad impression, it can give you anxiety, which is a person needs to get help about negative satiation. It doesn't matter how bad or how good the impressions are, it is important how people get effect. Second, I remember when I was first grade in elementary school, I did not want to go to the school. It was the first day I wanted to stay at home. On that day, I was a little bored, I took the big pillows from armchairs then put them together. I was trying to jump from the pillows to the other sofa. The first time I jumped it was successful. After a moment my mom caught me. I was kind of scared, she told me it was dangerous, and I can hurt myself with that. After she left, I put the pillows together like I did it before, then I jumped to the wall. The walls corner was really sharp, and I hit to the wall. I realized I hurt my self so bad. Then I went to my mom, I was holding my head and crying. She was so mad at me, then I took my hands off from my head, it was bleeding so much. She called my dad, then we went to the hospital. In conclusion, I agree the reactions, impressions are impossible to change the consequences. It is really important what people felt or lecture extract.
