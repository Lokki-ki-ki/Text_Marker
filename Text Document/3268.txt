It has been said that a positive attitude is the key success in life, that having a good thinking about what you do, and be proud of it is important. Well, in my opinion it is the only thing, because time is going forward, and not backward, things that you have already done cannot be changed, but by having a good attitude about it, you change your future, like being successful in your goals, solve economy issues, and even in day to day life. A positive attitude is really important when it comes to achieve your goals, if you want something, but you think you can not make it, it is because you do not have enough attitude, in order to be successful with it, you must forget all the negative thoughts, and believe in yourself, and after all the effort you have been giving you will be a little closer to achieve your goals. Sometimes money can turn your life real hard, it can make you stop trying for what you want, and make you give up; is in this kind of situations when a positive attitude must come in, let me give you a personal experience: I used to live with a stepfather, my mom, and five brothers. At that time bills and debts were easy to pay, my stepfather was making around $3,400 dollars a month, my mom like $1,300 dollars a month, and my brother and I around 800 dollars a month, all this money was the house income, but after my mom and her ex-husband divorced, everything changed, now we had all those bills on us, but because we did not give up, and we had a positive attitude about the situation, we started to work even more, now my mom is single, and we can make trough out the month. Another good example is living every day with a positive attitude like at work, at school, at home, even restaurants, it does not matter where you are right now it is important to always have a positive attitude, it is crucial in life to be proud about what you are, where you are, how you are, be the one who makes the change. Some people say that because you did something wrong in the past, it is impossible to make a change about it, but they are wrong because they might not able to change the past, but for sure they can change the future by fixing and understanding in what they have failed, the attitude is important be proud of everything you have done and do not be ashamed. In conclusion, it is really important to have a positive attitude because to be able to achieve your goals you must have to have a positive attitude, money can make it hard for you to live, but you have to think and analyze the situation, wherever you go remember to have a good attitude about yourself, and never be ashamed about something you did wrong remember that you always can make a change, only if you have a positive attitude.
