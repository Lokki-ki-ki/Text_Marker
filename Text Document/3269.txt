Thomas Jefferson once wrote," Determine never to be idle... it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing." Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something, or does inactivity serve a purpose? I agree with the quote by staying on track, working hard, and getting things done can accomplish more. Staying on track can help people focus. Some students from my school today lose track and end up not doing their work. Later on students fell unaccomplished from not doing the work and not accomplish anything. If students can focus and stay on track they can achieve more. By showing effort and working hard people can accomplish more. My mother works hard in the hot sun to accomplish her goals. My mothers goals are to work hard, so she could pay bills, make sure her kids have what they need, and food on the table for her kids. My mother works hard just to show us if you do nothing in life you won't accomplish much. People achieve a lot more by getting things done. Soccer playerCristiano RonaldoPushed his team to the max by practicing every day to get things done, as a result from pushing his team and getting things done he leads his team to victory. Getting thing done is reaching for accomplishment and later on be an achievement. Although some people may say that inactivity severs a purpose, the real point to consider is that doing something can accomplish much more by staying on track, working hard, and getting things done will lead to accomplishing more.
