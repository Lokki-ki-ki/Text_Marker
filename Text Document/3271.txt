Many schools have partnership with local companies and organization allow student to do there community project and just to help out. Local work places like a store and business. Student don't have to work there for like 9 hours insensate they will work to hour a day. If the work for along period of time they will have a headache because they are not use to it. When I said community project like write an article about the company. Also help out is like if they need wood the students will give them. One way I think student should not work in a company is because the side effect is student wouldn't do their homework, they will not attend in class on time, and they will not study at home. What if the student did dome thing wrong there parent have to pay for it or the school. If the machine cost 10000 that is expensive to afford. Student shouldn't work it will make them get a bad grade. When you have a bad grade you will not be able to play game and use your phone.
