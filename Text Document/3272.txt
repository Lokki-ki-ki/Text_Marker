Some people chose to be different from other people. Some people act different from each other. All people different from each other. Some people always in a happy mood, Some people always sad. Some people always mad. I believe all people should be happy. Is not fear if someone was sad or mad they all should be happy all the time. Some people they are sad became they lost there job, or they lost there mom or dad they always going to be in sad mood. Like some people lost there mom they always going to be in sad mood no matter what. None can change them. Some people will change but if it was someone lived with his mom for a while like 25 years these people going to be sad forever. And I hope they will be happy. Okay now less talk about mad people they bad personalty these are not good. They always in a bad mood. Some people have anger issue like they get mad so fast they will do bad stuff like beat there kids or wife some people get drunk and get crazy these kinda people need help some people break everything in the house this not good at all they some people are mad became they have3 jobs a day and is very hard when you have more the one job. Or they get paid bad or they just don't like to work. Some mad people always fighting in schools they always get kicked out school. But they will change one day. Now we can talk about happy people they always happy. They have good jobs. They are rich they might have a lot of money. Some people are just happy no matter what even if they are poor or they don't have nothing they still be happy. Some people just happy even if they face bad stuff bad job bad money there boss trade them bad not good even they boss don't pay them good they will still be happy one day every person in this earth poor people, masd people sad people, they all going to be happy one day and they going to be a team a strong team they going to kill the word sad or mad we all should be happy we all live once.
