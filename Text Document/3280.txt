I agree with Churchill's statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success. It is true that to be success first, you need to have a clear mind of what you want to be or to do. Because in some cases can be very struggle and difficult to be success. For example, a very famous statement says,"After the storm comes the calm." This can be similar with the Churchill's statement. Because this explains that it doesn't matter how worst you see it, but it would be great after the problems, or you are struggled with. Furthermore, to be successful you would pass by a hard thing, for example something that people says,"Nothing is impossible if you don't try."and"Nothing is easy in this life." This is a true statement that all people have to do, and we have to know.Additionally, the word"failure"plays an important role to be success. One important thing is that if somebody loss her or his enthusiasm or will power can be worst because that means that you are giving up what you have already and for that you already worked for it and don't want to fight that victory of success anymore. Sometimes you can fail but that doesn't matter because if you tried and tried again and again after you can get it. That would be one of your goals that you would remember. This shows how important is going from failure to be success. Finally, to be success we would failure first because by that you would know what you did wrong and that's why failure pursuit an important role in our life to be success.
