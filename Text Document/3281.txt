Should our school extend the school day two hours? No, I strongly disagree with extending two hours to school day. By extending two hours of school day, students for sure need to take a rest, take a shower, some students need to do chores, and also focus on their goals after school. If we extend two hours of school day, then students would not be able to focus on their education, because the brain cells need a break and need to refresh itself. Furthermore, if there are 4 days of school and 3 days of no school, then students will forget what they studied 3 days ago. In Afghanistan, schools adopted a four-day school week, with each day consisting of ten hours. Therefore, we are comparing the grades and attendance of students. With extending two hours of school day, this system had effect students educational life. Students are not showing up to school, and they skip school because of the new system. This idea had discrease the number of attendance and the grades of most of the students. Finally, the regular school days and regular school hours are more beneficial than the new idea of extending two hours of school. If we want to focus and have good attendance, therefore we should not extend the school hours. In conclusion, we should keep the school days and school hours as it is.
