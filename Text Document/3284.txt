Dear: principal think that the policy is unfair because not all the students have a B range, and they want to be in a sport team or other thing. I why don't you change the policy to C's. If not the team's are not going to be complete and the school could lose all the games. Many students might change schools because they want to be in a team. Sport's teach disciple and team work witch will help in their future live when they grow up. When they get a job were they have to do team work it won't be so hard because they already now how to communicate and show team work.STUDENT_NAME
