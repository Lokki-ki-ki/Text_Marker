Do you think is good idea for student to finish high school in three years?most in one point is good bad in other point is not perfect because when a student takes the four year of high school is most be prepared, when someone took three of school is not on total prepared. Most kids want to take three year, but they don't think about it; they think is easily for them. Take time and thinking, most student who follow THS plan most don't take elective classes courses for the simple act that finish high school early then other students. Kids who finish high school, in four year they're going with knowledge that they know better than other, some high school's have programs three year until two years to study, but in some high school's it is necessary make four years for wherever reading or for that is traditional four years as well one motive is because student after graduate they will go to work they don't go to college and that's why they took three years. For example one's of my friend's took three years and her sister took two years my friend's who took three years she said that her don't have the option to take elective classes for the simple reason that her will graduate in three years from high school. But when she took one career of college she don't what is going on, because one of her classes has nutrition Welles, and she didn't know anything about it. Her sister took two classes her only have three class; crime, cooking, and government;and her teacher says that her want the opportunity of wanted to come night school for finish the three classes, but she graduate being of time, her graduated in March that normal graduate for us is in June. But if some high school offer that program is subs to you is good to take just three years, but is opportunity take four years to graduate from high school. Most student follow that opportunity three years to graduate because they want to enter the college early or work.
