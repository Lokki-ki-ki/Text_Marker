One small acts of kindness can help other people by doing little things for them. Helping people with a small act of kindness is helpful because they probably have never ever gotten a sweet thing said to them or something kind to them. Anybody should be kind to one to the other because it's something kind to do. It can have an impact in others because it can litter lay change the world by being kind to another. The reason why it could change the world is that people in this world don't care to be kind but if everybody does it then it would change by a lot. Just by saying something kind to someone could make someone's so happy that's why doing something kind no matter how small it is, it could make someone really happy and amazed and if a person could treat someone like that there is a possibility that they could do it to other people and the kindness could go around. Kind is what an a lot of people need and its something great to do. You can impact someone by saying something really simple but all of it with kind. In my opinion I think that kindness is a wonderful thing and I can believe that it's a huge impact for others.
