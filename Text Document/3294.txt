Having a homework club after school isn't just a great way for students to get HEL on homework but for many other reasons. These are my reasons on why I think having a homework club is beneficial. Students don't just get help on their homework, but gives them a better understanding on the subject. Students also finish their homework and get a good grades on it. Staying after school can encourage students to try harder on homework and school work as well. Staying for homework club can also make students to be more productive than going home and not getting homework done. The homework club isn't just beneficial for students but as well as for teachers. Teachers can see questions that many students had a hard time on and then go over it. Teachers find it useful to see questions many students have a hard Tim on so that they can practice. Teachers feel good about students finishing their homework and understanding the subject better. In conclusion, I think having a homework club is a great thing because students get a better understanding and getting their homework done. It encourages students to do better in school, and it is very beneficial for teacher as well.
