Working with a group would be much easier because you have less work to do by yourself also you would finish it faster. In my opinion doing it in a group is helpful by having less work for yourself. For example, doing all the work on your own would take much longer and probably won't do it right. Also, I've done projects on my own, and it takes a lot of time and a lot of effort to finish it and turn it on time. Needing a group would be helpful not just for me but for everyone who is in it because by doing together we would all get a good grade. Being in a group would make everything much easier for everyone. Doing your project won't take as longer no more because we would do it in groups. For example, doing your stuff takes to long when doing it yourself. As in doing it all together it would be much faster. Everyone would take a part to do of the project and put it all together. In a group everyone would put a part of there assignment they have done to pull in the whole project together. There was this one time we all got to pick are group to this big project about the earth we all got a part we want to do. We had to full weeks to turn it in but because we all did want was assignment to us, we finish in a week and turned it in and got "A" for our project. In for all doing it in group would be much faster. I think by doing it in a group it really helps because you get to know your classmate more. For example, you can get to know them by talking to each other. By getting to know your it's a good thing y'all can all become good friends and do even more project later on. It's also good way to comutate with others in your class you haven't talked to. This one time by math teacher made us to get into groups but I didn't know anyone in the class but, a girl invite me to go with hers and I did ever since that we are always in the same group together, and she became my best friend. By being in a group will help you get everyone in your class.
