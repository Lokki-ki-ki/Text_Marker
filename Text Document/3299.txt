In some societies, students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school. Their courses of study in high school are selected to guide them toward a specific career. I strongly disagree with this prompt because once we enter high school we are transitioning to a bigger school with more new subjects that catches our attention. My reasons for disagreeing is that I was once a rising ninth grader and I would be unhappy with the career I wanted in my freshman year. For example when I first came into high school as a ninth grader I wasn't sure of what I wanted to be once I graduate. Now I am a senior at Generic_school, and I have to option to choose from. In my perspective I believe that at a young age mindset changes; you find new interest in things and also our mind isn't fully developed at ages fourteen or fifth teen; we aren't mature wisely on what we want. I think the student should start preparing them self once they're in junior year which is when they're an eleventh grader. My reason for saying that is because you're close to graduating and need to start planning your future, looking for scholarship, and making sure you want the career you've chosen for a long period of time. I don't think it's a bad idea but I wouldn't agree with it because I know how this generation is like, and we need more teacher to start talking to them seriously about life after high school. This past year a huge amount of student have dropped out of school because they do not feel like they have support from teacher, friends, or even their own parents; or maybe the student think they can't afford college; not many teacher talks to them about financial help or support.
