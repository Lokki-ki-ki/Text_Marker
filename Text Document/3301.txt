According to the prompt I would have to agree because impression is something you get when you get to see an old picture of you when you are a kid, or when someone makes a surprise for you, you get that impression, you start crying or just smiling. For example, one of my experiences was meeting my whole family for the first time in my life, when we came to the United States my first impression was that I saw a lot of new things, a lot of nice cars, big houses, and a lot of people. We stayed in Texas for 2 days, we call my uncle the first day we stayed in Texas, he told everyone in my family that we made it, we took different buses like for 3 days just to get to were my family was. When we get there they went to pick us up, my first impression was to see all my family back again and that impression I will never forget it, and it will be never be change. We went to my grandmother's house, I was nervous because in that day I haven't seen my dad for more than 8 years, and when he came through the door I got that impression of seeing him again, I was so happy to see him again.
