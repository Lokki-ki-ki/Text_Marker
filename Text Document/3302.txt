Yes I agree with this quote, because all students have a chance to learn, so in my opinion, I think that is a great opportunity, for all of them to learn. Some of them has a job, maybe with that same job. I think some of them they have a chance to support they family. Maybe they leave lonely, far always from they family, or they have to help their parent pay the rent, or other stuff to pay in they own too. I think they will have a benefit from being able to attend classes from home, because the schools give them a new way to progress.First I think it's would be a great benefit is, at same, same time you can do other activity, and you can take it whenever you want, before or after work it all depend on what you think will be better for you. Secondly if you have some family problem, or you have to go somewhere immediately for a long time. That is an opportunity for you to learn or to not loss all the days you have been absent at the school.Another opportunity is if you go to college, and you have a job at same time, if your classes are in the morning from 8 AM to 4 PM, and you job schedule is at 1 PM to 11 pm. At that time you have this big opportunity to sturdy and learning online, before work, and you have some time left to do your homework, or other thing that you have to, or you want to do in that day. It's not only online you take the class online but, you will have a video conferencing to motivate you, that if you not understand, that can explain it to you. The school give them a big opportunity to progress, to have a good education and a better future. For me, it is a great option for them to attend it.
