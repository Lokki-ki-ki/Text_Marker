Setting a good example by your own behavior is the best way to influence other people. People can see that you are being a good person and setting a good example. They can see you are being good and that they will get influence by it and would want to be a better good person. People that are not behaving good can see that you are being good, and they would want to change to become a better person instead of setting a bad example. I think people that set bad example's should change to become a better influencing person instead of showing a bad example there will be a lot of good people in this world if everyone showed a good example, so everyone can see that being a good person is better than being a bad person. Like in school you can show that you are doing your homework getting good grade. S showing good example's to other's, and they would want to be the same as you, so they can do good in school just like you get good grades pass the grade and do homework to not fail. Showing a good example to better to show it with the way you behave.
