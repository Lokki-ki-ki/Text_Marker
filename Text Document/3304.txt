Based on my experiences I would say that is not true because people always can change.I'm my opinion I think people say that because with the person that they are talking to, or they are meeting does not show interest on them. The first impression is not the best sometimes, but that it does not mean that it can not be changed. You can not classify or judge a person for their first impression because that person can change. One reason why you do not have to say that first impression is almost impossible to change is because if the person that you are meeting is not having a good day that can affect the first impression because he/she is not going to be comfortable talking or having a conversation At that moment. If I had to give an example it would be the history of me and my best friend. The first time when I met him was in my math class, He did not even want talk to me and be my partner, when I asked him about problems that I did not understand he ignored me, and he did not answer. To conclude If I would have to take a position on this issue I would disagree, the reason why I would disagree is that in my circle of friends there is 2 of them that they did not give me a good impression and if you look at us today we are good friend and that is why you do not have to say that the first impression is literally impossible to change.
