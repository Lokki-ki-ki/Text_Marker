Technology in people's live. Technology has a positive effects in people's live, make you do thing better and easy, like if you don't want to go to the library you can read a book on the internet, or if to don't want to go to the store and buy something you can buy that thing online technology is one of the more important thing in the world for many reasons, doctors use the technology to help you when you have a problem and see what it is, or in the airports to see if you don't have something illegal if places like this don't use the technology is very complicated to do the job and more time to do. In school, we net the computer all the time to do the homework and test and now is an important thing to have if you are in the school and no't only in the school also people that work from home or in any other job they net the technology, most of the job in this time net a computer, or any other type of technology, some people say that technology make negative effects in people life but on my opinion is not true because most of the people who say that use the technology to say that is bad and affect the population. I know the most of the people use the technology, or sometime of their live they use the technology and the technology help they to do something, a lot of the medicament that we know on this day's are created for the technology, technology is not only computers and phones technology can be something pretty simple like a clock, is not necessary has to ve something very sophisticate, some people say that if you use the technology you don't have contact whit other people and something is true but that happen when you use the technology too much, but it doesn't mean that technology is bad if you use appropriate. What people net is responsibility to use the technology and know when they net to use, that way we can be more sophisticates, we can use the technology to talk, play video games, etc, but we can also have time to stay with the family and friends.
