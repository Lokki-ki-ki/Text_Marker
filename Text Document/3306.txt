Have you ever done an enjoyable educational activity? It is fun because you can play instrument, make a science fair project, or act in a play. The reason why playing an instrument is fun you can play instruments such as play the tuba, clarinet,trumpet and many more you can also preform at a concert in school or out of school those are all the reasons I think playing an instrument is an enjoyable educational activity. Next, are the reasons why completing a science fair project is also, an educational activity you CN do many projects like figure how long it takes until an apple roots, or even see how far your paper airplane will fly those are all the reasons why doing a science fair projects an enjoyable educational activity. Third, why I think acting in a play is an enjoyable educational activity. One of the reasons why I think this is because you can wear a costume, preform on stage and, also read plays from William Shakespeare. Those are all the reasons why educational activities are enjoyable.
