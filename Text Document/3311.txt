Did you know that everyone choose their on character traits? I choose my character trait in my house, I choose my character trait in my job, and I choose my character trait in the school. In my house I can choose my character trait with my action. My brother character trait is to lied everyday at home. In my job I can choose how to use my character trait from my customer and my friend at my job. For example If I use the same character trait from my friend to my customers my customer can feel bad. My character trait at the school can be a happy or serious character trait. For example when I am in class I am serious but when I am with my friend in lunch my character trait is happy. In conclusion my character trait is how I decided to make it.
