How we know the first impression is important and not always it's impossible to change it with our actions, and attitude, it depends on the situation. Sometimes the first impression can be good. For example if I'm going to meet my girlfriend parents or if I go to meet my friend parents I need to have a good appearance to give a good impression, but we can have a good impression but that can change. However, if we do bad things like with our girlfriend if we treat bad her the parents are going to have a bad impression and that can change or with our friend if we don't help or if we give bad adviser to him the parents can think bad about us even if the first time we get a good impression. Sometimes the first impression can be bad. For example in a job interview, during the interview if we don't use the correct language or if we go with bad aspect we can't get the job. However, even if I give a first bad impression that will change if in the same interview we use a good language and if we respond the answer properly that can help you and finally in my own interview a give a bad aspect, but I use the correct language in the interview and I get the job that's why I think that can help you in an interview when you get a bad impression. In conclusion the first impression not always It's impossible to change if we know how to deal with it.
