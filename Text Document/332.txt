Is it better to finish high school early? Yes, I would say finishing high school in three years is better. Why? Because you can start college early, or go into the work force, and you can have the time to explore the world. By doing this 3 year program, you can start college early. In today's society, finishing school early may be a big benefit. If I had the chance to do this program, I would take that chance. You may be looked at different but in a good way. Also, by starting college early it can be a huge advantage to your future. Finishing school early can bring you into the work force. I would believe by finishing school early, it can be a huge benefit for looking for new jobs. Also, putting on your resume that you graduated early, the employers would look into it and see that you had to take summer and evening classes. You would look your very intelligent and responsible. If having a year off, and don't know what to do, you can explore. If I had that year off I would use the time to see new things, things that I've never seen before. By taking the year off, you would still be on track in your schooling. In life some people don't want to go into school because it is overwhelming. Have the time to go out, if not then you'll regret not having that time to yourself. By taking a 3-year course of high school, you can start looking into jobs, have time to explore, and you can start college early. Some say that finishing high school early, you don't get the same high school experience as others that don't do the 3-year program. But finishing high school a year early, can bring you more benefits than just doing the normal 4 years. In the future I believe that high school will only be 3 years of schooling.
