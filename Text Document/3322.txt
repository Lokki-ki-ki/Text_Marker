Are first impression almost impossible to change? Most people would say no, but actually it is possible. You just need willingness, hard work, and a title of confidence.First, if you want to change any first impression, you have to will it. You need to have a vision of how you want to change it. Most people try to change their first impression, but the thing is they don't have a vision. Without a vision you are going nowhere, you most have a vision. Lots of people give up, but I know you can do it, because failure is not an option. Always remember will is power. Second of all, willing something is just the first part to change our first impression. The hard work is probably the most complicated, because is where you going to find some challenges. Challenges are part of life, so don't see them as impossibles, but see them as opportunities. You have to work hard to reach your goal, no matter what. Keep this in mind life is not fair, so you better keep doing and don't look back of what have you done. Always have a clear vision OG what you do. Finally, this is probably the most important part, confidence. Confidence plays a big roll to change our first impression. If you're not a confident person, it might be hard for you to change but not impossible. You can take classes to gain confidence like me which is helpful. I'm not confident person but took the ROTC class which has helped me to be more confident AMD not only that, I have learned to be a leadership too. If I can do it, that mean you can. Don't let anything stop you. Inconclusion, think about your future is very important. Changing your fist impression is a good start. You never know if that will affect your future. Just will it, work heir for it, and be confident.
