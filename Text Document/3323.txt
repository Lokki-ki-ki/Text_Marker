Having self-reliance is an important key to success in life because self-reliance is making your own efforts and decisions. I agree that people should make their own decisions because they should have freedom to make their own choices. They should think for them self. Having the freedom to make their own choices is important because if they can have the freedom to choose what they want the experts are going to choose something that they don't like, or want. For example, the person wants to buy some fancy shoes but the authorities don't like those shoes they are going to say no and decide to buy other shoes. In my thinking I would not like to someone choose for me because they don't know what I like, or what I don't like. If they let other people make there choices they are not going to be happy because the expert or the authorities are going to choose what they like not what the people want. For example, they go to the lunchroom and there is a lot of food there, and they are trying to get something but they don't let them get what they want because they don't have the freedom to make their own choice, so the authorities are going to come and choose the food for them. Another reason is that the person can think for them self. If the persons can't think for them self they are going to have a lot of problems in there life because if the expert, or the authorities comes and ask the persons something, and they can't think, the experts are going to think for the persons and make choose something that the persons will not like. In conclusion, having the right, or the freedom to make the decisions for them self is a good think because everyone wants to make their own decisions they don't want no one to be telling them what to do, or what to think. The persons are going to have the freedom to choose what they want to do with there life.
