The technology had negative effects on people's lives because now they can not do anything without phone or they don't talk in person with nobody that important to talk in person because you can see with who are talking. If you do everything with your phone you can lose you vision because the telephone has too much light, but you can play the games and not talking with nobody. For example in this time the parents when their children start crying they just give them the cell phone, why they do that because they now the kids gonna addicted to weight videos then that going to be a problem with the kids when they grow up they don't Anna talk with nobody but that not de kids fall because they parents teach then how to use the cell phone but they don't teach them how to talk with people, they need to lair how to talk with older people or teach them how to do other stuff. This is another example when parents go to the shopping stores, and they are in the store they loss their kids they are always in the phone they never can miss call, but they can miss their kids that not make sense because when they found the kids they star to saying thing.my opinion is we need to talk more share our ideas or meet more friend that better to be every day in the phone talking with people's like my mother always told me don't talk with bad people, but the thing is we never now when they are bad but that why we need to do everything careful, is better to meet peoples in person.
