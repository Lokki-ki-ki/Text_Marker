A lot of people ask for an advice, but others ask more than one person for advice. Advice means talking to someone for a recommendation. Some people ask one person for advice. Other people talk to different people. Talking to one person can help, but asking more than one person can help you understand something better. If I am about to do something that I can get in a big trouble for should ask my parents or other adults for advice. I would ask different people for an advice, because I can understand something I could do better. Another good thing about asking for advice is that if I go to like prison for murder, drugs or alcohol, in the future when I go look for a job nobody will want to hire me because of the stuff I did. If I am going to do something awful in school I should think about consequences that will be and ask someone or more people if it is going to be worth of doing. When I am having trouble doing something or understanding something I should ask others advice of what's a good way or doing it. I think that other people should really ask for advice. If someone wants to do something bad that they can get in trouble, or they can ask for advice. Is someone wants to make new friends they can ask something for an advice to tell them how they can talk to new people. If I am having bad grades I can talk to my teacher to tell me how I can get my grades up. And that is why I think advice means.
