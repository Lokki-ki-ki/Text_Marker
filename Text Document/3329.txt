I say we all choose are own characteristic traits because everyone has an option. For example: The British naturalist John Lubbock was sophisticated person as one his characteristics traits therefore he had the right to write and read when other didn't have the choice. When John Lubbock choose to become a politician, but also a naturalist which he chose to become one. When John Lubbock wrote this prompt he took action to write it instead of be influence by others and becoming the same as them. Because if all politicians were the same and influence by each other every time they would all be the same and wouldn't have made their mark. Back then I haven't known a lot of British politicians that were naturalist as John Lubbock but, until now because he made his mark. People should have to make their own choices anyway because you can't work as a politician and always agree with what people say and be influence by it, you have to make your own choices. In between that John Lubbock shows he's made his own choices about this and you as the reader to think about it also and makes a choice. When it comes to talking about what characteristic traits we have its based on the person who decided to become whoever they want to become and control their outcome in life. In conclusion the way were based on the way we act or show who we are, for are traits
