I disagree with this statement because thing that are made up from mind seems to be not real. First, Knowledge created stuff that is real. Lastly, Knowledge can make you be rich. Knowledge created stuff that exist. For examples: a car that had been made by a knowledgeable person, can solve your lifetime problems, but an imaginary car is not real at all. All humans have the knowledge to read. People today have invented a lot of things because of their knowledge. In conclusion, there are so much stuff that had been invented(created) true knowledge. If you present the thing you invented from your knowledge, a company might respond to you and say,"hey, people really loved your invention. We should work together." For example, you have the skill to invent a phone, and you rolled that phone to a person, and you made a huge amount of money. You would want to invent more and more to make a lot of money. You learn that skill from knowledgeable teacher. In conclusion, knowledge can help you with your lifetime. In conclusion, Knowledge created stuff that are real. People have made a lot of money true their knowledge. Finally, knowledge is more powerful than imagination.
