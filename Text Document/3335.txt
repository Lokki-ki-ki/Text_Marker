Everyone has a talent or skill. Everyone can do anything, Imagine going to America's got talent and seeing people's talents and skills. I am identifying a talent or skill I have, and explaining how I develop and use it. To begin with my talent, my talent is roaring like a lion, is like a deep voice and just pushing air in my throat. My other talent is hula-hooping with my arms, just making circles with my arms for the movement of the Hula-Hoop. My final talent is drawing, I enjoy drawing because I can draw what I'm feeling but I need to be more detailed. Next my skill, my skill is swimming fast, I only use my arms and legs for more movement and I would need a lot of energy for it. My other skill is running fast, I use my legs and ball up my fist for more movement. My final skill is holding my breath long, it's risky, but I would beat my friend's scores.Finally, both of my skill and talent, my favorite talent is roaring because I would scare my friends, and it's funny. My favorite skill is swimming fast because I can possibly beat anyone's scores. My least favorite talent is hula-hooping with my arms because it's not really impressive anymore. In conclusion, now I believe that everyone has a talent and skill. Don't be afraid to share your talent, embrace it and share it to the world. I am identifying a skill I have using specific details and examples.
