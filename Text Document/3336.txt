I agree that imagination is more important than knowledge beaus in imagination I feel like you learn more about your brain and that will help you a lot of knowledge you really don't learn anything you just learn how to other people choose what you like. Imagination you can think about what to choose like if there is a car you like image if you didn't choose the other one that one is going to the dumpster if was one good car and one ugly car but if it was knowledge you will have pressure. You will not know what to pick, or you will know what to pick if you use your imagination. Knowledge you really have to decide what you want but imagination you just can image like what are you going to need that in your life like if you had to choose a house or a car what will you need more in life that's why you use your imagination so I rather pick a house beaus you will need that house when you grow up like for your kids. Knowledge I feel its bad for you in the butcher. When you go to college you will have to use your knowledge for school i guns that is pretty good, but you are just going to image like you are done in college.
