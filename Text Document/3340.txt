I disagree with this statement because you are supposed to have knowledge imagination is like dreaming but when you have knowledge you can put your mind to something to create something big in the future like having your own company, and you can sign workers and to make them delivered stuff to people and all of this is reality even though you need to finish school and go to college and get a degree there it takes time you have to get your mind set and encourage your self to do better. You can also help people if they need help on something cause you have already been thrown all of this like how to get a job or how to make your own job and to encourage somebody else to just put there mind to it so that person that you helped they can also help somebody then it goes own forever and forever, and you can tell them how you succeed in they can follow in your footstep, and they can tell another person who they succeed, and they can tell there story imagination isn't reality it is when you are sleeping or thinking but knowledge you will need it if you are in a situation.
