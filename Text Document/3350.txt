I think curfews do keep teenagers out of trouble, and it helps them sleep on time because after those hours a lot of lawbreaker are on the streets and something bad could be happening outside or on the streets like gang fights, shootings, robbers, drug dealers, drunk drivers and many more. The first reason is shootings mostly happens at night late after 10 p. m, and it would be better to stay inside in those hours than to go outside and for example a teenager is walking home from a friends house late in the midnight and gets in a fight with gang member and gets shot. While it would have been better with the curfew in place. Curfews help teenagers go to sleep on time well like on the weekdays when they got school the next day and sleep on time and wake up on time and be refreshed for a test or something for example a teenager has school the next day and since he does not have a curfew he sleeps late, and he misses the bus and forgets he has a test that day. And another example a teenager has a game he does not sleep early, and he wakes up tried and is not able to play the game as well as he could. Curfews could also help teenagers mange their time appropriately and how they spend the day for example a teenager has a project or a homework the curfew time will help know what he/she must do first before he/she have some free time and goes to sleep. In conclusion adopting the curfew idea would be good because it will keep the teenagers out of trouble and help them manage their time appropriately.
