I'm completely agree with this quote, because actually is hard to be yourself, a person who don't even know who him is and his proposit in this world and a society were literally nobody cares about who you are, your aspect and your skills that probably going to be used to enrich other people who doesn't even know you. Sometimes life could be misleading and maybe will be hard to find yourself or your proposit. Even your family could have 2 faces and make your way harder, that's why you need to take care who you trust and select correctly, there's bad people and just because the blood is shared doesn't make them your family. Nobody has born to be the center of everything, even if everything looks impossible you are still able and free to be the person you want to be even thought is hard when the world is facing you and making impossible little things, but sometimes you need to accept that something's ain't for you, nothing is just when they are made to people with more opportunities sometimes you will feel that you will never get a good chance to do what you actually want. The future and the time could be creepy, but you need to remember all dreams are possible if when you keep them in mind, is not impossible to be yourself is hard and sometimes sad when you get lost trying to find who you are but at the end life will be good because you finally going to be the person you want; Because trying to be yourself in this ugly and unfair world is the greatest accomplishment, at the end nothing is more important than you.
