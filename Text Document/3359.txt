Is true that many students would like to graduate early with all the credits they need already, few students get to have that many good grades of all their school years the makes them able to graduate earlier, but of course, that's not something easy to achieve, some students maybe don't mind to taking all 4 years of high school to graduate, but others would like to take the 3 years and still get all the credits they need to graduate, even tho that may take them more work to do to achieve that. I think it would be a good idea for students to be able to graduate with three years of high school, with the same idea that they will have to take summer courses and evenings to get all credits in three years, and the advantages of that would be that they will get out of school earlier and be able to star college, work, and a career at an earlier age, and also for students who don't like to spend too much time on school stuff, that would be like a way to get out of that faster and achieve their goals quickly, I have some friends that they graduated earlier because they had good grades, which made them have enough credits to graduate, and they're doing good right now, because now they in college and achieving their goals, and I believe it would be a good idea to give other students the same opportunity, if they want to take it.
