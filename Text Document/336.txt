I believe that is good idea for the students to commit to a career at a young age. Instead, it is important for the students to find the specific career and graduate before time. In point of view, some students can choose, if they want to a specific career or more. In thesis statement, students can find the specific career because is great opportunity and good idea. First reason, some students are considered to find the specific career. Because they want to enter to the college at their young age. For example, Generic_Name was prepare to enter to the college at her 17th years old, and she wins a scholarship, and enter to Generic_School to study her specific career. This shows that students can achieve their goals at their young age, that nothing is impossible. Second reason, some students have to find the specific career. Because they want to prepare before graduate of high school. For example, Generic_Name had her classes pass and all the credits before 12th grade, and she applies to the college to her specific career. Being students it's not easy to achieve this specific goal, but with work hard and perseverance all is possible. Third reason, some students think that they can't commit to a career at a young age. Because they don't have courses to guide toward a specific career. For example, Generic_Name is in 12th grade, and she wants to graduate before, but she doesn't pass her SOL, and she has the enough credits for graduate. So this shows that students can't commit to a career. If they don't have everything that is necessarily to find the specific, so they cannot achieve anything. In conclusion, it is important for the students to find a specific career at a young age. However, it is a great idea to find the career that proponent to achieve before the time of graduate and get all that you need like: credits, grades, exams, and courses. Also, this is a great opportunity if you want to be someone professional in this society. So be positive and perseverant.
