Today I would like to talk about students averages and participation.Students are complained because they want to participate in sports, and other activities, and they think it is not right that they have to have a grade of B average to enter a sport class so dear principal I would like you to keep the rule of ravening a c average to enter sport or other class available, and I would thank you if you would not change it for the students that are doing good in there class's and there work.Student commentI think you should not change the schools' policy because it would not be fair.I think if students don't have at least one fun class they should not come to school and school would be the boring thing ever and if you have to work all day you would be tired and your brain would stop working as good so that is what I think about the schools' policy.
