Is working with a group is Benefits? In my opinion working with a group is better than working by yourself, becuase when we work as a group we can finish our work faster than working alone furthermore in group work you can make new friends, you can learn how to work as a team because in group work you have to make sure you are being nice to your teammates, and you must listen to everyone else point of view in group work people you learn how to respect others. Working with a group have more benefits than working alone because if you have a big project to do and your teacher allows you to work as a group, but you choose not to join any group and decide to work alone, so this will be hard for you to complete the project on time and the people who join the group can easily complete the project before you because they can help each other this is the biggest benefit of working with a group. In group work all the members of the group have to do equal work and this way they can do their part of the project very easily and if they work alone they are not able to work that well because they have no one else to gave them advice or any kind of help therefore group work is always benefited. Some people might think that group work should not be allowed but in my opinion group work is the best way to study because this way you learn about how to be nice to someone and how to be responsible for your work because in team work you always have to do some part of the work which your team members told you to do, and you all can share your thoughts about your work and can get better grade on the project Group work always gives you benefits.
