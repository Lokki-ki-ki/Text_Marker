I believe that positive attitude is the key to success in life. What I mean by that is being nice and giving good feedback to the things and actions people do and say. We can show how matured we are. We can be examples for others that are living with us too. I have a friend and her name is Generic_Name. She plays a lot of sport and one of the sport she plays was soccer. Generic_Name's team always losses, and she used to tell her team that it will be fine and that they just need more practice. The next Saturday they are having a game. All her teammates are scared because they are positive that they are gone be losing without even being at the game. Generic_Name told them losing is not the end of the world and being scared does not help them to wine the game. At the end they all promised to each other even if they don't wine that they will be happy to be able to play. On the other side there is my little brother Generic_Name. He is 12 years old. He never liked math. I always try to help him do his homework. One day I saw his test and he had them all right. I was not surprised because he was working so hard. Whenever he gets his answers wrong he would say that it's fine. I will do it again. After he came home he said his teacher gave him candy and that he gave it to his friend. I was so amazed. I couldn't wait to ask why. He said because his friend was studying so hard and did not get any candy he felt bad. Over all positive attitude is the key to success. Whenever we don't fell like we are having negative energy we should ask and understand that it could get worse. By positive altitude we could get more that we lose if we are having negative attitude.
