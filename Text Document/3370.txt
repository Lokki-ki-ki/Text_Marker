Recently technology have been a great impact in our lives and around the world. People use technology for contacting, social media, and ordering food online through an app without going and picking it up. But technology could be bad for some use like getting wrong information about an article that you read, or you can get a virus on your computer by going to an insecure website. Technology is making human beings life easier than how it looks like. I clearly believe that technology is a positive way to use because you could do so many things with technology personally think that technology could make you accomplish many stuff and achievements. Reason why technology could be helpful is with school work. Say that your teacher give you this article and tells you to wright information about it and gives you book that has barely information about the article. You could just go on a computer and find a lot of information about the article that the teacher assigned you with and complete your work. In conclusion, thank you for your consideration of this important matter. The issue of my opinion on positive thinking about technology.
