For some people that is not a good idea to finish the High School in three year, because in another part is not agreeable and unjust for some student who study for four year to see something new, so this is disagreed because the students need to study four year in High School. Finish the high school in three year is a big bad idea because is too short to finish the high school, and another parts some students don't want to go more to the school, so they choose that new program for a short year to graduate in high school. The other parts are not for all High schools to finish in three year, so is better to delete that program and cancel about to finish the high school in three year and the students who follow that program they need to take the normal high school. To change the new program for all high school of the country is not easy, because some schools don't agree to doing that so is better to continue the traditional four years. If they change that program for all schools of the country they have a big responsibility about that, because most high Schools they have a big problem and work for example to change like that credit for graduate to the high school, the SOL text so is not a very good idea to doing that. The conclusion, this is the best option, is to follow the rules of the schools. One should not make a big problem with the laws and the constitution of the schools. It is obligatory of the student need to take the high school for four year that is better and continue with the traditional four years of school.
