I guess it's a good idea Because it helps the students to complete their homework with support from other people, with this club it will help a ton of students that has trouble or problems with their homework. This will be a great idea for many students that has trouble doing their homework at home or doesn't understand or their stuck on their homework, but the other reason people don't want to add this club to the school is they don't like the idea of having it they say "it's a waste of time for us" or other more things that they say, some other students might say they don't have time for it, or they don't want to join the club. But it is a good idea to add this club for the students who don't understand how to do their homework, if other people don't want to join they could just get a bad grade for not doing their homework. If you join the club for sure you will get a good score for doing your homework and probably get good grades for doing your homework because it helps you learn or practice at home for a test or a quiz, so maybe it's a good idea to add this club to the school after school probably a few days, because it will be easy to complete your homework every day and turn it in every day if you join the club. If you join the club you could finish your homework early then your other classmates, if you do complete your homework early you could have free time at your house and not do any work cause you complete your homework early and not worry about doing work at home cause you already completed your work.
