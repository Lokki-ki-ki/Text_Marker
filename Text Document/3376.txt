I think older kids should not be paired with younger kids because they can be a bad example, not being good around young ones, and not respectful to younger Kids think they should not be paired with younger kids. If a older kid does something bad the younger ones might do it to. It can go super wrong like if an older kid does a trick in a skateboard. The older knows how to do it. But the younger does not know how to do it he can break. Something arm or leg. One my brother was with his friend doing trick on his skateboard and I tried to do it but I fell and Brock my arm.\I think older kid should not be around younger kids. Because they can be on drugs or be smoking who knows. That is bad for younger kids if a kid see you smoking all the smoke can go to his lungs and maybe give him cancer or die. My fiend Generic_Name brother was smoking around us, we told that smoking can kill us and him by he didn't Lease. I think older kid should be respectful to younger kid and everybody. So they don't to be like them if you're respectful to other younger kids can be respectful to others. But if you're not respectful others are not going to be respectful. One my friend brother was not being respectful to us, so we were not being respectful to him. This is why I think older kid should not be around younger kids. There not respectful, bad example and there not good around young kids. If they were respectful, responsible it would be ok around younger kids.
