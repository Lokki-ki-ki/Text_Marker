Dear Principle,I think it is wrong for you to not let students with a C grade average to participate in sports or any fun activity! I think every student should be able to participate in sports and/or any other activity because the majority of the students here are still passing with a C. Also, it would be fair to any other student here to participate. Many students like to play sports such as Basketball, Baseball, Soccer, Volleyball, and much more! Also, if they are not really interested into Sports they would love to go in Clubs such as a Recycle club, Art, Reading, Computers, and more! Many students would actually improve they're grades to keep on participating in sports or clubs. I really think you should let us students join.We would appreciate the changing. Please and Thank you.Sincerely, Student
