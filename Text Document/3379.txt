Working with a group or working by yourself. There is nothing more beneficial than to have a team work, having to work with people that you like, and the people that know what to do; is one of the best thing that could ever happen to you. Now working by yourself gives you more benefits like, no one is going to steal your ideas or just copy what you do or write about which happens a lot when you are working with a team. Working with a group is more like team work, is more like people doing less, what I mean by people doing less is that when you are working with a group you normally don't do a lot, you are all helping each others and that makes you more like a person that is not secure of yourself, is like a person that will always need someone to be helping outworking with a group is not too bad, but it can be, me as a student I do like to work with my friends but they're always copying me which I do not like, it makes me feel like they will not be able to do good in life without me. Is sad the way they always have to be in a team to be a better person in life, which is not fair because sometimes they are not even the person that did the work. I prefer to work alone better than to work with a team, is not like I do not like to work with other people; that is just how I am. When I work with other people I feel like it doesn't benefit me because they are either cheating or not helping, working by myself makes me feel more me, it makes me want to keep going without having to worry about others. It makes me feel like I can do more without having to need help from others. In this world I have learned so many things, I have learned that you need to put you first, you need to think about you first, also that you need to have your own back. Working with a group in my opinion is something that should never happen, you might be asking why?. And my answer is that you should never feel useless, you should always think about yourself.
