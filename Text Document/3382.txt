As students are getting involved in activities and extracurricular activities and get better in their educational experiences and others students are having short time to do their homework and assignments, so this decision should be left to students and families and sometimes school should control. Some students already know what they want for their future life and doing these activities they are enriching their educational experiences and getting ready for what they want to do for their future, so in this position schools should not control this enrollment on this activities instead they have bad grades, missing classes or being absent to school. For example my friend Generic_Name likes technology, and he is taking an academic class and to take that class he needs to go to another school but lucky his main school gives him the opportunity to take him to the another school, and he already knows that this class will help him on his career and his taking care of his grades and at the same time taking care about his academic class. Now there are other students that are doing this activities, and they are not total about what they are doing, and they are forgetting about their school. So if this is happening is when schools should control students enrollment in these activities because they will have bad grades on their classes and will miss school year and this will affect their careers. For example, I do not know what I really want for my future, and I am getting involved in many activities at school, but I am not forgetting about my assignments for school and I do not have band grades. In conclusion there could be reasons when schools should or should not control about students involvement in this extracurricular activities because sometimes they will have question about something, so school may help to answer their questions.
