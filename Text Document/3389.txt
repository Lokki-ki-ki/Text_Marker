Former British Prime Minister once said that "success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm". I disagree with this statement. In my own experiences I have never failed to succeed, I have always failed to fail. In 7-11th grade I have tried out for my school basketball team and never made the team. I have also experienced doing something on my first try and succeeding, Failure never brings success. All throughout my life I wanted to play basketball for my school. The only problem was every year I tried out I never made the team. This year I am a senior in high school and still haven't played basketball for my school. I have realized that no matter how good I got it wasn't enough. Personally I can not relate with failing to succeed because it has not happened to me. I have never been able to fail and then succeed. I can say from my own experiences. Something's just come to you and your able to keep being good at it. While there are also things that are not able to do on the first try or ever. For instance my seventh grade year I was trying out for football. I had never played a game or ever tried out. First try and boom I am on the football team. I played left tackle and was a starter for "A-team". I had never played before, and I was already starting. Furthermore, I didn't fail to succeed, I just succeeded. As a result from the facts I have stated. I do not believe or agree in "failing comes success". Failing happens to everyone and I have yet to hear someone say" I failed to succeed". It is very uncommon for someone. If it has not happened to me in all of my seventeen soon to be eighteen years of life i don't believe it is possible.
