The life of some student's, of wants super ate. I believe and think, that all students already graduate of the schools or university, they can work in a place where they can have some opportunity. Also, they can put in practice or demonstrate your abilities. However, I think that they could, should have the best effort about their, and then they can remember all the things about they're learning while they be studied, as well I think that all the students that they do not have age for to work, like student of the14 or 15 years ALD they can have a high for to have a part-time. Although, nobady can be denied one job for the students want to have a job for getting more experience. In my opinion, every student, they can have a right, to demonstrate your abilities, and then they can have more ideas, and get more experience for survive in his life. Also they can be more smart, while they're putting in practices your abilities, because they are gone putting the best effort. Even think that they can be indecent by your self, also they gonna recognize all the effort of the parents didn't for their Also too I think they can choose what carrier they would like to take, or they can be thought what is better for their or what is gonna helping in the future for getting a better life, that is my conclusion, about what are talking.
