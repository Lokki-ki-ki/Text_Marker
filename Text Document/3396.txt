I would like to be a guidance counselor because to help kids with problems or personal. To show that the counselor is here to help with anything. To give them advice on how to be confident and everything goes all wrong, and soon it will get better. If they are getting bully to support them and give them advice or with personal problems to. To show the okay to fell sad and hurt soon it will okay and to show them to not let people boss you around to show that they can't boss you around you boss your self around and to be brave and take a risk and to see the world differently. Remember that someone will always be here to support you and will always be here for help and get you through thing that make you feel mad or sad. Cheer up your day with some happiness and I choose the job because I want to help kids on what they are going through and to put a smile on their faces and my counselor supported me and my family I want to help another family like he/she did you me. To help student that don't have money, food, and clothing. Students can ask me for anything like my counselors did for me and my family, and they inspired me to want to be a counselor and help others and to ask for help when you ever need it. In conclusion not asking for help to your counselor is not going to get you anywhere.
