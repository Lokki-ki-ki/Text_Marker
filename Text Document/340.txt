Should schools have a program that pairs older student withe younger students? Well I don't. Schools have rules that must be flowed and if they are not flows the students or teacher can have a big consequent. I don't think that schools should have these programs beaus, The younger students stint to answer most of the questions. Also, the younger students may get boiled by the older students. And most of the older students play around in class. To begin withe do you think that school shooed have a program that pairs older students withe younger students? Well I don't beaus sum of the younger students answer more cushions then the older students. For exam pal they are more attentive in class, they mostly study to get good grads, the younger students now more of the cushions than the older students. Second this is way schools should not have this program beaus the older students play too much in class. For example they like to joke around to make the class lathe, They also like to be Laud most of the time, Also they call the other students names which is also bulging.There'd the younger students may get build by the older students. The older students can pick on the younger students,Sometimes the older acts tougher to the younger students, Also the older students bully the younger ones in finical operas, That also way school should not have this program. Do you still think that schools should have this program? Well I still think no. Beaus younger students answer more quash tons, The older students talks too much during class, and the younger students may not now how to define him self s if an older student is bulling him.
