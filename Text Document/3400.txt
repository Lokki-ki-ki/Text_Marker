DEAR PRINCIPAL:I believe that the first policy is better because phones are good but no when are use in class.Just imagine that something is bad how are they going to talk with their parents if they don't have phones. What would happen if something bad would happen after school how are they going to call their parents and if you don't let them bring the phones at all their parents would probably get mad. Then the parents can go and have a protest that wouldn't be good.That's why the first policy is better.Sincerely,Your student_NAME
