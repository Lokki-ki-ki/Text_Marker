Do you think is it a good idea for students to start a career at a young age under 18 or not, student should make their own choice? In some societies, student are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school. First having a career in a young age, start work (having a job) and living by yourself. Its like middle school and high school switch around you're pranging to live your life as adult instead living your life as teenage. At that age no one knows how to spend money or mange too. Money is like water you have then spent it, all gone. Then the other choice not having a career in a young age, living their life to the fullness plus spending time with family and friends. You don't have to worry so much about paying bills and other things. Your family will support you no matter what happen, you could go out with friend. At this point you could spend more time on studying mostly importation on yourself. Be honest i don't think is a good idea, It takes time to grow up to be young ADULT!!! Yeah, sure everyone makes mistaken but learn by it even if you're old, young it doesn't matter.
