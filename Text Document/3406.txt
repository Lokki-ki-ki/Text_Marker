When people ask you for advice they sometimes talk to more people than one they ask for a good advice because if they will not have good advice they can't think about a good decision sometimes a person who have trouble in her or his life or any depression our any happiness in their life they can't make control their a control on them. So they get panic sometimes they can't think what to do they don't know how to do things so that's why they from many people but when they seek multiple opinions, so they get confused they can't select one opinion that is good for them, they want to think about that, but they can't do that, so they ask many people for different opinions so that's good but also not good tho but so they need to figure that what they should do or what not what I think is its ok to ask people their opinions, but we should also need to think use our mind without our mind we can not do anything the opinions that are given by other people we should think about them like what are they saying what's the point is it good for us or not or if I will follow this opinion it will make trouble for me or not then u will ask your friend or a person that is so close to you if that person will say yes you will be like ok than. let's do it!so you do a whole long provision for getting a one good opinion what you need to do is that ask opinions from two or three people and then if u think it's not a good opinion than think your own and then take a good decision. Everyone takes their own decision I think if you want to ask for an opinion find a good trustful adult who really wants to help you who will give you a better choice and then think about it if you think that she or he is right then just follow the directions for example I have a birthday party and I need to select the dresses for everyone and arrange the birthday party and I don't have enough time I am so worried and confused I don't know what to do.I need a help from people I asked from my friends, cousins, family, teachers and then I think that I have a lot of opinions so I can't choose1 so what I did was I asked my older cousin and then we discussed about that she told me in details what to do and then I managed my time and i chose the dresses I arranged the birthday party in one week everything was so good that's how we make better choice for our self if u can't do that at least think on your own or ask for help and ask from a good person not anyone you don't know well because people can play with you, so we have to be careful so I think asking an adult is better than asking a lot of people because asking an adult will help you more because the first time I need help and I asked a lot of people and I was so confused and I was like what is going on with me because it was my first experience I didn't use my mind it was so bad waste of time every thing was ruined and that's why I learned something is never do anything that your parents or adult don't like here is another way to make a better choice and that is always listened to your parents and your adult because sometimes the decisions that you are making it seems like they are good but after some time you realize that it's not good for you u get in trouble and all you have face something's so that's why do what your parents are telling you to do not what you want to do it's ok to listen to your heart, but sometimes it's not so the best way to make a better choice is listened your parents and adult is use your mind to think that it's good or bad the 3rd way is to ask someone who is an adult and such a nice and truthful person believe in your self and your god these are the best ways to make a better choice we should always believe in your self and your parents because they will always tell you a thing that is good for you no matter what it is just think that your parents tell you to do that and again believe in yourself if you will everything will be good if you be felt good believe in your god because he will help you everywhere he is with you, so these are the best way to make a good choices are these.
