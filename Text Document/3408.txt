The most enjoyable way to spend time outdoors is hanging out with friends, spend time with family, and do fun activities or games outdoors. These are a few things to do in a sunny day outdoors. Hanging out with friends can be fun if you make it fun, you could take bikes rides together, talk about problem or achievements you've accomplished, play games or just walk around. There are plenty of different things you can do in these parks, it's just up to you what you decide to do. Other way to enjoy these amazing parks is by visiting it with your families. Talking about how there day went can bring you guys closer and make them feel a bit better, going to eat or bring food at the picnic tables can be fun as well, maybe know more about what they have been doing or what they are planing to do over the weekends, these are a few of things you can do outdoors instead of being indoors. The last and final thing and most important in my opinion is to have some time by yourself, there's no better way to relax and enjoy the outdoors is by yourself, you don't got to worried about anything just walk around take in a deep breathe of nature's air, see different things the might not be seen before only on TV, and meet new people with the same interest as you or just have some me time. These are a few of activities you can do outside with friends, family, or by yourself to enjoy the good outdoors and the weather.
