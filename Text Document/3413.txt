I agree with this statement because, positivity is the key to success, if your always being negative and saying negative stuff it will be hard for you to find success. My dad once told me that whatever you do in life and even if you fail you should always tackle it with a positive attitude no matter what. Having a positive attitude has great benefits when it comes to work place, your personal business and even life in general, being rude or disrespectful to people won't pay, there is a saying that says what goes around comes, so if you treat people with a negative attitude, in the near future somebody will treat you the same way. Attitude is very important in life, attitude determines if you're going to be a better person in life or a bad person, attitude determines how well you are in treating people with respect. A good attitude goes a long way, even if you don't have enough money, or you struggle to pay your bills having a good attitude and being positive will land you into a good job and also by meeting great people. Having a bad attitude can even ruin things that you know how to do well, if your suppose to be doing something, and you do it with a bad attitude it won't turn out good, you will always end up doing something wrong because of your attitude. At the end of the day attitude counts, treating people with respect is very important, and it will take you places you have never thought about.
