First Impressions are almost impossible to change this is true, but they can also slightly change a little over time. I personally agree that is almost impossible to change an impression about someone so lets say that I agree and disagree because the statement is right but not everyone is the same, your thoughts and the way you think are different from everyone else, so the way you feel about a person could change over time. The first impression of a person about you could change over time just like your first impression about someone you've never met before could change as time passes and y'all get know each other and hang out, go out to eat just like in a relationship, when the girl meets the guy, and he looks so handsome, respectful, polite, nice, generous, very responsible from her point of view, when his at school, work, even when his home or even to the point of calling him sexy even if he is the skinniest guy ever you would tell him "Wow baby, you're so sexy", even if his not you would say it because you wouldn't want him to feel bad or anything to ruin that bond but when you guys start talking even more, start to hang out more often that bond will start to grow stronger in confidence and trust so when that time hits, It gives us a whole 360 degree spin now you start to be more open with your partner, and you actually start saying the real things, I'm not saying you have to lie but people in specific try to cover their lies with other lies and sometimes it don't even work, or it doesn't add up at all but what I'm saying is that when that right time actually hits you start being more open, and you're not afraid and for the same the reason, you guys develop your ways up and work it out to the point of building a really strong trust, that confidence in you guy's eyes, that key to your heart and let everything be free. It will take a while for you to see the proof but probably not to long, but the results will come at one point and don't doubt it. However, with your first impressions you will represent yourself to the people or the way you act or the way you act in the beginning it will make them know if your child dish, immature, or the opposite. If you put that respect and honesty in the beginning people will treat you with respect but if you like to mess with people yell at them without respect don't expect something else because it will come back to you and there's this verse in the Bible that I like that says" what you plant, that's what will grow" I don't think I wordily got it right how I said so what its meaning is if you're a lair don't be mad or don't ask God why is he doing this to you because that's what you planted in the beginning. When you meet a person what are the first impressions you get of that person on how they look, act and talk. When I first came in Generic_Name class and actually met her, my first impression was she's very nice, knows how to properly talk to students and as time pass I got my points proved right. Sometimes it is almost impossible for first impressions to change but its never to late it could come to the time it does.
