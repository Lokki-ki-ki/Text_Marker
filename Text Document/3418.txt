Students should take four years of high school, instead of three years, because students can have more time to learn, students can have electives, students can enjoy their summer vacations and their evenings, and finally students have more time to do stuff. Althought some schools think that is better to offer programs that allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years, actually students should take four years of high school. First students can have more time to learn. For example, in a year students can learn much stuff, and they have energy to learn, in the summer students just have two months to study, so they don't have much time to learn all the stuff they learn at school, in evenings students have three months to study, the classes start a 5pm and end at 7pm, so at that time students are tired and they don't have much energy, so it's difficult to concentrated and learn all the stuff. Second students can have electives, students can have classes like gym, art, and music students can discover new talents in that classes, also students relax their minds in that classes and enjoy the school. Third students can enjoy their summer vacations, students get tired for study ten months, is good that they can relax and pass time with their family and friends, so their mind is clear, and when they start study they have good attitude, energy, and they want to learn new stuff. Finally, students can have more time to do stuffs, because they can go home and do their homework, study for exams, pass time with their family, and have good sleep hours, they don't have to worry about go to school in evenings, they can relax. Students should take four years of high school, so they have more time to learn, they can have electives and learn new things, they don't have to study on the summer, and they can enjoy their vacation and evenings with family and friends, and finally they can have more time to do status.
