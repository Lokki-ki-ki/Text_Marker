I think working 10 hours a day is way better than working 8 hours a day you can save a lot of energy and electricity and your time in a day. In 4 days working 10 hours a day is like 40 hours a week. Still if you want to do overtime you can still do overtime on Friday and Saturdays. Working 10 am to 10 pm is better than working 8am to 4 pm. I think my school should change the school hours and save some time. They should extend the school hours to 2 hours so that the kids can get enough sleep when they go home, and they can do there work at the jobs too. If my school extends the school hours to 2 more hours than kids can get off for 3 days from school. That's how schools can save a lot of energy water etc. teachers can get 3 days a week off too if my school extends 2 more hours and make it to 10 hours. There should be just 4 days school in a week. Some people have hard time to wake up early in morning, so they can do there homework. When students get enough sleep they can focus more in their studies, and they get more time during weekends to do there home woks. That's how students can achieve there goals in high school when they get enough sleep they can stay more fresh and active during school hours. In high schools most of the students have hard time during the whole school year just because they do not get enough time to do there homework during the weekends most of the students work 32 to 38 hours a day, so they do not get enough time to do there homework son Saturday and Sundays.
