Summer breaks in most countries are 45-60 days long. Students mostly enjoy the summer by going to a vacation or doing fun stuff. From students' point of view, 60 day summer break is the last thing they want to lose. However, most student lose track of their studies after spending such a long break away from school. Furthermore, being 60 days away from your Frisbee practice would massively impact your game; and the same applies to studying, you will forget most of the lessons that you've learned. One might say, "well there are summer classes to keep students connected with their studies." But to be absolutely honest, no one wants to go to school in a hot summer day. We all want to lie low and have a cold drink in beach while listening to the satisfying sound of waves. What is the solution? Put an end to long summer breaks (not completely removing them), and instead give students a week off after every 4 week of studying. It gives students and the faculty a brief break after every 4 week, and also it gives students time to work on their important projects. For instance, if I'm studying History of US Museums, I can get a chance to explore the museums and write an article of my own observation about museums in my area. Student can't get everything done on weekends, so they need more time. Teachers on the other hand can keep track of the students during the 7-day break and ask them for their progression. Moreover, this gives students to participate in community services and/or religious services, which in my opinion, are crucial in building one's character. The summer break, however, is still there but shrank to 2 weeks, giving students a chance to go on vacations and trips but not for long. All in all, 7-day break after every 2 week of school keeps students involved and connected to their studies, community and religion; while giving them the freedom they need to enjoy their summer without losing track of all the studies.
