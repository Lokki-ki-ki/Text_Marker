I would share that life is not easy. Enjoy your life as much as you can. Enjoy your childhood. Because when you grow up you won't be able to go backing the future you will do a lot of responsible things. Enjoy it bore it ends. Everyone goes through something in their life. Everything will get better. Just don't think negative. Always look up never down. Cause if you do look down you won't see your bright future that will come. Do good things in your life. Like be nice to people don't be rude, disrespectful, and mean. That's not going to help you in life. What's the point of being mean. Don't take your anger out on others. Just because someone else did something to make you mad. Taking your anger out on someone who didn't do anything is not going to help. It's making the problem worse. Things happen for a reason, Maybe it happens to teach you a lesson. Don't rush things in your life. Give things time, be patient. You don't know what can happen if you rush things in life. Everything has a time, you just have to wait until it comes. If something happens it happens you can do anything but to hope that things will get better. Life for an example, Let's just say that someone important gets sick. Like really sick that they had to go to the hospital. Its scary right? But what can you do to stop it. Nothing but to hope that they will get better. that's how life is. Life teaches us a lesson. We need to believe, have hope in life. If we don't how can we know things will get better. We need to have hope to learn the lesson. The more you give hope the more you believe, The less you try everything is completely blind. For an example, I gave up and stopped trying. But that didn't help. Things got harder for me. I didn't have hope. But then I realized why am I thinking negative? And not trying. How is this going to help me in life. I opened my eyes and began to try. I started to believe. It helped me a lot. Life is never easy. Life is full of lessons that will teach us something.
