In the years Thomas Jefferson be the President in that years many people loss they job or many people don't get the employment many people died for not get food or medicine they would not have job to get money and buy what they need to continue to they lives. The people who life in the past they now are us ancestor but when they live the job it's in the farm or building they jobs are very hard, and they work a lot and not get too much money for the families, the money they get for one day to work a lot and the little money they get it's not too much for to get food, water, medicine etc. In the past the people don't have the technology we had on today that works they do its coming to heir because they don't have the machines we had today to get the jobs easier. Every day the technology we have on today that technology help us a lot to get the jobs easy and more easy, and get more money to buy the all things we need to buy and pay to continue with us life, in the past and today the jobs is the property to all we need to do to get the resources we need at home. The jobs are not only for to get money the jobs It's for to get the experience to one day on the future we need to teach to us children's to they get a better life and when they get a job they know what they need to do, and when they are adult they form they own family and the experience they get in the past they would teach to the family. In the all world we had many countries they had different jobs and cultures the experience we get for others countries that help us to do better things day by day.Every day, all people go to they own jobs, and they use a machine to get the job easy and don't get tired quick we don't need to work all days we need to spend time with the family and do a food watch a movie talk about what are doing at job, school, the family is the property more important in us lives, we need to get a job for to get that families in good healthy. The children's they had less than 16 years they don't understand the importance its to get a job and get money we spend in the future to buy a new thing the people invented or to buy things for the family, this children's they only think about games, friends, and they don't think about the importance the family is and saw how family is very happy when they see we do the same things to the experience they teach, when parents teach something they do to us get a better life and don't get bad friends bad decisions, bad influences, they think about own future they want to see that little son grow up for to do good things in own life and don't be never go down, us parents want to see we form a good family in a good place and that family never go down, the children's we need to teach the all good things in this world and don't give games, phones the electronic devices for they birthday, they don't need all that, the need spend time to family in a river camping on the beach, but the electronic only do bad things, I saw a children's more young than me, and they smoke, consume drugs and that thing it's not good for us healthy, if you do a tattoo when you go to find a job they say, look it's a gangster member and when you listen that you feel awful, us families and job are help us to us future be a good person. When you lost the job that is hard because you know all about that job, and you don't find a similar job, when you get a job don't go a sit or look the iPhone, the boss get mad, and he says don't come to work anymore that is terrible situation. The money we get for a job that help us but the money its go and coming again its things about the life its happen forever and never change the people are being scare to spend they own money, but the money come aging, when you spend the money you get for a job you would think in what you need to spend that money. Maybe a get all this wrong but I try written all things a listen, saw in my life my experience. The things of the job you would need to care and don't be destroyed, that thing help us to get that job for too much time and get more money to do wherever you want, when you come to other country, and you go a house, and you saw too many things, but the person had all that he work a lot for to get all he had in his house. The jobs are important because the time we had in that job, we have grown up and the experience we get its go up to come to a professional one day. Every day, we need to wake up and think what you would do in they all day, try to create a new thing use the technology we had for to do wherever we want. We had too much time to think and create, invented a lot of thigs maybe that help a people in the future, the people are very important because its they don't invented thins like a machine all technology today we saw in the all world, the jobs they had its invented things new every day and surprise the people. The jobs this persons had, the technology help they a lot to continue and the population grown up. In the past to many years ago the population it's not like today we had technology and too much thing that help us a lot every day, the population in the past hey don't pay the bills like today, rent or something, they would work on they own farms and grown up everyday, the ancestor we had in the past they work a lot, and they suffer because they don't get a lot of money for buy supplies to they family. You know much people say I don't need to work my parent give me all I need, but they know what importance it to get own money by us self, that money it's your, and you do wherever you want. In this world many people everyday they wake up and they don't do nothing they only walk around the house and they don't go to work they avert they family, friends only for not go to the job, the family and many friends are important because that people help you to continue your life, if you alone you would be got fell sad, and you cry, and you would get the smoke drink alcohol, and you destroy your own life, you would need go outside and spend time with family and friends every day, and be happy.
