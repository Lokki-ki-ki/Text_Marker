Being yourself is being true to yourself and to others for example. When you're hanging out with a group of people. Don't act like someone else but yourself because you will get caught for trying to be someone that you're not and get made fun of for being something that you're not. It's better to be yourself because you want people to like who you really are. Not someone you ain't you're just lying to yourself and others. Ralph Waldo Emerson was an Author who believe ''to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment''. I agree with that statement but not, so many could say the same. There is many humans on this planet who can't accomplishment being their self than being someone else than their self. Many people struggle to be their self because of society. Society brainwashes people to be someone else than being their self. Nowadays being yourself is lame and being someone else is Amazing to some people. There is con on being someone else like lying to people until they fine out whom you really are. Then they might not like who you really are then your feelings are hurt. Therefore, your friendless and hurt, But you could always pick yourself up by being yourself. Then by over time people will start to notice how you change, and they will want to have relationship with you. It's healthy to have relationships with you being yourself than being someone else. The reason why I am saying that is because you don't want to be lying to the other person the whole time during the relationship. It will bring problems to the relationships.However, it's always a good idea to talk it out and come clean. Being yourself make a huge impact in people daily life. It could go for the good or the worse it's all up to the person. Therefore, It's important to be yourself always no matter what or what's the cost of it. Also make sure to take pride of being yourself.
