I believe and agree with self-esteem comes from achievement because I've learned this from experience. The people who believe in the students must be self-confident in order to learn statement really didn't think this through when they agreed to that. Self-confidence really cant be used or proved to learn better. Achieving anything like a win in a sport or something positive you get at the end can boost your self-esteem. Achieving something or having a positive outcome after doing something can really make students think twice on how they shouldn't give on things and also boosting self-confidence too but just mostly self-esteem. I really have no idea what I'm doing or writing neither not knowing what self-esteem is all I know It's something to do with your thoughts or emotions. I only typed in what I know and what I think is the best response to this stupid prompt that made me stress out more and waste my time doing nothing and only sit here and think what can I type that makes sense that closely answers the prompt and really all I did was type and give it a statement and repeated with different words, I already know I'm going to fail this well at least tried and put in effort. In my conclusion achievements are the best way, for motivating people to keep going and never give up and somehow in some ways relate to self-esteem.
