Conserve energy and resources, some businesses have adopted a four-day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours because they can care about their baby and have more time for their family, Also they can have more time for all the friends, and be responsible for the house. If they have two or more day off they would try to do fomenting else. All people need to have time for care about the family and be responsible for their child. If we have more time with our parents, so we can expend more time on our school.
