I do not agree with adding another hour to school, because some of us would like to go home, some people have places to go after school. For example what if a student wants to go pick up his grandma from the airport, but her flight gets in while the student is still in school. If school would've ended at the normal time he could've gone to pick up his grandma. Even though staying an hour more would help students more, there won't be anytime left for after school activities. In the winter time it gets dark fast, and some kids like to go outside and play for a while after school, but if they add that extra half an hour kids would have to get home fast and leave there stuff to go outside for a little. There are many bad reasons why adding another hour to school is a bad idea but, there are many good ones too like a good reason would be kids can catch up on there missing work, a bad idea is kids go home later than they used to and some parents would not like that. If they do add an hour of school they should open the school at 8:30 instead of 7. If we come at 8 kids would get more sleep and not fall asleep in class with more sleep kids have more energy and with ms are more energy kids are more productive. In my opinion I don't think adding another hour is not so bad, just that no other student would want to stay another hour. Students could get frustrated because all the work they do at school, and then kids got to go home and study and do there homework. Therefore, I disagree with the idea of adding another half an hour.
