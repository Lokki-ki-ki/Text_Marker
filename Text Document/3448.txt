One of the things I want to accomplish in the future is to graduate from college and become a pharmacist. One day I was thinking about what I would want to be in the future and my goals was to have a job that I would be able to help people in and enjoy it. I wanted to have a job that I would be exited to go too everyday to help others and make my parents proud. So I thought about becoming a doctor because you help people, but I don't think I would enjoy that job and I don't like being at the hospital, and just then I thought about becoming a pharmacist then I remembered that my parents have already told me of it as a good job to have, and it actually is, it will make my parents proud of me, I would help people get the medication they need, and I'm sure I would enjoy it.
