McDonald is one of the most fast foods, and people who work their get paid a small amount of money, so if students can come, and visit this place maybe students will see how people without an education or not doing anything at school will end up and a job like this, so I would choose a job that don't't get paid that much to show students what happen when you don't do your work at school or pay attention. Students might change their minds of playing around in school from visiting this type of job students will see people working hard and fast every single day and getting paid a small amount, so students would not want to be working at a place like that in there future, so it could pursue them to start putting more effort in school and not to play around in class, and have a successful job. Some parents don't have money to put their child in school Furthermore there are going to have to work at a hardworking job, but students don't have to because you have a chance, and you got your education, so it might teach students to take this advantage to have a success job and not to play around on the other hand teens that don't get their education will work at a place that pay a small amount. If students don't take their education serious your parents paid the money for your education and if you just don't pay attention and not try the money your parents paid will be a waste because you didn't learn anything cause you goof of, and you won't be able to have a successful job so visiting this job will change students thought pf whether they should play around or not so if you take your education serious you can have a job that pays you a lot of money and be successful in life but not doing anything in school won't get you anywhere. I would right a letter to McDonald because I want students to see what happen when you just play around in school or your parents don't have money for your education because the employees at McDonald work hard, but they get paid a little but if you take your education serious you can have a successful job in life, so this might change students mind of whether they should pay attention or not and students will take this as a chance, so they won't end up a type of job like this.
