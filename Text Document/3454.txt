I think self-esteem comes from real achievement because if you're not doing your best work In class, and you feel like it's not good enough, and someone tells you what you did wasn't good enough then it will just make you want to do better. On the Other hand If you do try your best and the work you completed is good, and someone gives you a lot of compliments then it helps you build a better self-esteem. Therefore, you got to be self-confident also, why? Because if you're self-confident, and you apply for a job you will manage to be confident that you will get that job, when you go to an interview. If you practice being self-confident It will help you a lot in the near future. If you got an affinity for a type of shoes and someone else tells you're ugly how will you feel? Of course, you will feel some type of way because that's just how the human body works, but you know what? It don't matter what people think. If you Got an affinity for those type of shoes then it don't matter what people got to say about your shoes. At the end of the day It's what you like not what other people like. People will always judge you no matter what you wear, what you look like, and how speak. Always remember that only god can judge you. Therefore, you should take the negative stuff that people got to say, and turn them into something positive. That will help you build up better self-esteem because you always got to be yourself no matter what. Don't be something that you're not just because your friend likes you that way, be yourself and if that friend is really your friend he will accept you for whom you really are.
