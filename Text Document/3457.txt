I think that students should start an after school homework club. 3 reasons I think that students should start this club is so that they'll have an easier time doing their assignments that their teachers give them, they can work together to get their homework done, and students can work with their teachers to raise their grades up in a specific subject. My first reason is that students can have an easier time doing their assignments that their teachers give them. My 3 reasons that students can have an easier time doing their assignments is that the students can ask their teachers for assistance if they need it, they'll get their work done quicker, and when their teachers come to collect their work, the students will have it already completed. My second reason is that the students can work together to get their homework done. My 3 reasons that students should work together to get their homework done is so that they can turn it into their teacher once they're done, they'll have it all completed when their teacher asks the students to give their homework up, and they'll receive a good grade from their teacher. My third reason is that students can work with their teacher to raise their grades up in a specific subject. My 3 reasons that students should work with their teachers to raise their grade up in a specific subject is so that they can be more productive in class, they can catch up on what they've missed in class, and the teacher can guide the students on what they're confused on their homework. Overall, these are my reasons why I think that students should have the opportunity to have an after school homework club.
