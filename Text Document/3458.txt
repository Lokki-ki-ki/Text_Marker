I agree that we accomplish more if we are always doing something. I think it does because it helps us learn on what to do. We can teach other the same way as well. We have other people helping us in different ways. For example, we can teach them different ways on doing things they don't feel comfortable and that they would feel conformable if they keep doing it. Although it may take time to get use to it, they would have experience at the end. Also, those people can teach other people. Learning new stuffs is hard but if it's a good idea people should do it. I think we can make a difference by learning new things in our lives. For example, if there were new ways by playing video games then people should learn it. Although it can get people mad if they lose or anything else. It can be helpful to others in the world. I think they would know a lot more if they did. We would get a lot done quicker if we had a method on it. For example, other people helping out on big protects to make it happen and work every well. Although it would need a lot of taking to one each other. It can help by not getting to one another. Getting to know new people by doing things. If you're not doing things you won't get anything accomplish in life. For example, if you don't do well in school that can effect your life by getting a job. People can stop being lazy and do their work. They can ask for help if they need it. If they ask they would have a lot accomplish.
