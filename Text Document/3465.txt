There is a debate about to take a music, a drama, or arts class, should students need to take an electives classes. Some people believe students need to take a music, a drama, or art classes. I believe students need to take electives classes, so students can choose the classes they need, students have more opportunity to choose classes they like, and they can choose the classes with more opportunity for get more credit. Finally, students can choose the classes they need to graduate. First reason, is students can choose the classes they need, so they can have more opportunity to choose the classes they need for get the diploma, they can choose the classes for get more credit, this is a good idea students can choose an electives classes so they can talk with the teachers to choose classes they need to graduated. Many others students do not like music or drama classes, students have opportunity if they can choose electives classes, so they can have few classes, they can have more time after school if they have a job. Second reason, is students have more opportunity to choose classes they like, many others students don't like arts or drama classes, in my opinion this is a good idea students can choose classes they like, this help students to work in classes they like and have a good grades. Last reason, students can choose classes with more opportunity, students can choose classes can help then to get credit for the diploma, students can talk with teachers they can help then to get classes they need, this is an opportunity to students they work after school, this can help many students to get a good grades and pass all they class. In conclusion, this argument can help students to choose classes that can help then to pass the grade or maybe to graduated, this have many opportunity to choose electives classes, in my opinion i don't like drama and arts classes.
