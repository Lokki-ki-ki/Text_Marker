Everything in life is enjoyable, but we just have to find the fun in it by using our imagination. A test can be enjoyable because you can proof that you smarter than other people by getting a high score and that's fun and proof the people that they were wrong about you. Life is enjoyable because you have a lot of memories that happen since you were born until whatever age you are now but time is relative so don't stop having fun in life. Enjoyment can come from many things like getting a goal in a game, a hundred in a test, accomplishing something for the first time, but there are many things that can bring joy in life. As you get older you learn new things, you get wiser, but also you have more befits and disadvantages. For example, adults and older people have money and with money you can get things and spent it in anything you want and plus you all can drive and go places and that's what people enjoy too. A huge disadvantage for adults is that they have to work for 8 or more hours, but either way imagination never gets old, but instead it gets newer. Adults and kids or teens however you all want to call us, but we are the same the only difference that we are younger, but we all have an imagination awake or hibernating and that's what allows joy in peoples life even for the people that barely have it awake. Everyone needs to live life at its fullest being joyful trying new things like sports, music, or even puzzles but time is relative you're stopping yourself because you think your getting old but that's not the case do everything you want to do before time runs out for you, and you'll leave with regret but everyone needs to wake up there inner kid inside them and start living life without regrets try new things, talk to new people, spend more time with your partner or family etc. but make new memories and be jolly and have such enjoyable life to new things you'll try.
