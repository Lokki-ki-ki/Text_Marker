A character is defined by what to they do? Like for Example the main character in the story is the one that has almost the most attention of people, and others are just supporting the story, But can we make our own character in the story? A character is defined by what do they do into the story made by their improvements, skills and influences. For Example: A character that like to be actor in a story is because he likes to be a character into a story. Here are some Reasons character will be himself something that He is like to do in a story and not what people want because too many people like the same story and everyone has different options.a person that thinks that He create His own character it's totally wrong what happened is that He like the character a lot, and He thinks that the character is doing what He wants.Thatâ€™s why many people thing that they can create their own character when the only thing that they do is to choose their favorite character in the story or been in a movie. A character is the one that do all that he can give and not the one that has more power because in the story their work is to make people thing that what happen in the story is true. For example at the end of the story some characters are acting like they're dead or any other reason to tell the public that the story is real and make people thing that they are into the story too. Like I said the job of characters is to get the attention of the person who is reading the story or watching a movie. But going back to the question if we can make our own character? We can't make our own character, Is just that our favorite character is formed by influences, and improvements to make hem a better character in the story.
