I agree, because I think the influence helped people when he or she's smocking too much and need to stop smocking because the smoking is too bad for the body and think. The other Think is to bad is the cold because when people drinking too much after making crash. I thinking the position is because the parent don't influence when she or he is younger. For example; when Iâ€™m children I'm living with my grandmother, but she tells me when you have like 13 or 14 years old don't smoke because the cigar is not good for your life. And other example she tells me is not drinking beer.I'm remember one thing and I don't forget is when my grandmother would me is contion with yours goals and don't stopped. The other influences in my life is when came to unite dusted I don't speak English but now I'm speaking better because I ready book when stay home or when I have time. And other example because I'm speaking more better is when I'm not understand the question I tell my teacher can helped me in this question because don't understand to much. One example when the teacher tell you, and you listen is if you need speaking more better is listened to the teacher when she or he prey something, and you paid attention. One example when I finish the high school is I want to be a soccer player and I want to player in one famous team. Because what is one goal in my life and because the soccer is the best player in the mood. I also what is one goal for me is because when a have like 5 or 6 years old I play for the first time. I think is the first because all of my family love soccer and players. My other goals are finish the high school next years. And start to work for helped my parent and make my money for something I need for myself. And also because I need to make money for pay my college. And for pay car also.
