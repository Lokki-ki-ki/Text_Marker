Adding another hour and thirty minutes to the school schedule is just a waste of time! It means having to miss time with my family. It also means having to wake up earlier to get to school. Teachers would have to stay back and work longer but probably get paid the same amount for ten hours. So I disagree with having to add another hour and thirty minutes.First I don't think kids would like to wake up extra early and get ready for school. Once the students get to the school they would be half asleep, and it would be harder for them to focus. The students would have trouble staying awake, and they would have more attitude than what they have now. More students would be marked tardy and there would more students skipping classes just to get some sleep. Not every student would stay awake throughout the day and finish there work. Adding an hour and thirty minutes would also have an impact on teachers. They already have to wake up extra early in order to be here on time and stay late to work on grading papers, going to meetings, etc. It would be harder for them to stay awake and teach. Teachers don't even get paid enough. So why would they want to stay back and serve more time. Some after school activities would get canceled and student that would need those after school activities would get mad. Complaints would start coming in and parents would get mad and ask why their child is failing. Some sports would be canceled and athletes would get frustrated because they won't be motivated or asked to go to a certain collage. Students would get low grades if after school activities were to get canceled. The school would become a laughingstock. Adding an hour and thirty minutes would have a bad effect on the school and the people in it. There would be more trouble than there is now and students wouldn't get motivated. Grade levels would go down and students won't focus. Teachers would have trouble staying up for ten hours. Family time would be shortened as well.
