Should school weeks consist on four days with days of 10 hours of school ? On my opinion there is no point on doing that, people that work is going to miss hours at work because of this, students are going to use that extra day to not study and be home doing nothing, and people instead of using electronics at school are going to use them more at home. Some students work after school, they need time to go home and get ready for work and with school days being longer it would be pointless to work, you will be making 3 or 4 hours a day, some students, specially on senior year, need to pay bills or make money for the future to pay college. On my opinion the best thing to do is to keep the regular five days at school, and to keep working at least six hours a day. Teachers and staff members are thinking that students are going home, and they will do their homework or study, but what they don't think is that some people need help with school work, or they feel more comfortable studying at school, now with that less day they will be more students failing projects and exams, for example if a student used to study at the library after school he is not going to be able because it is going to be late by the time he gets out of school, they should keep the normal schedule for all the students that are getting benefits from people wants to save energy and money by taking away a day of school, but they don't think that students will be going home to use their cellphones, watch TV, play video games, and a lot of more things that consume energy, if they stay at school they are not going to be able to use their cellphones or any other electronic device, they will just use it during breaks and lunch, so that is less time than being home a whole extra day. For all this reasons a think that it would be better for students to keep with the regular schedule and keep coming to school every day, for the regular hours, in that case they will not miss any hours at work, they will have more time to study and to do homework at school, and they will not use their electronic devices as much as they would at home, even though the idea of saving money and electricity its such a good idea some students don't understand that, and they will not do it at home.
