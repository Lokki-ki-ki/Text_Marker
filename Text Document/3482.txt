Kind, caring,nice. Those words explain the meaning of a person if they are trying to be their self. Although some people may think it's okay to be yourself in a world where its always trying to change you, nevertheless, some people may think is not okay to be in a world where It's trying to always trying to change you into something else because people should express them self how they want to they shouldn't be in a world where its constantly trying to make them into something else and people should live how they want to live. For example, people should express them self how they want to be they shouldn't be in a world where its constantly trying to make them into something else. People have all right to be who they want to be but if you in a world where it is trying to change you that is not a great accomplishment. Clearly people should be who they want to be. Therefore, people should live how they want to live. Everyone picks how they want to live in a world some people pick to live in a world where people get to pick who they want to be and some people pick for them self who they want to be. But it's NOT okay to live in a world where everyone picks for you u not making a great accomplishment for yourself. If you're making a change for your self you should be living in a world where it doesn't judge you for trying to be something you want to be, and you turn your self around and be come something where everyone wants you to be a call it "great accomplishment".
