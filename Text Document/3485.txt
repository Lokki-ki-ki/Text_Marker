Business managerHello I hope you're doing well, my name is Generic_Name. The present letter is to let you know that I'm fascinating of your business management, and I'll be glad to visit it. As you probably know many students are compelling to participate, ind agate, and discover about distinct occupations in the work place. I think that it will be the most exiting thing that I could do because probably I can find an appropriated place of my interest to work at. In fact, I can learn about the responsibility and most of the time the pressure that some workers have. The importance of follow the rules, every little thing in the work place it could be important for me in the future. To adapt in different positions and the most important thing is to love what I would do, to be an implicated, and passionate person in the place that I would like. Nevertheless, many people hate their work because they never had the chance to visit many places that they wanted, couldn't active their goal or may be the position that they wanted was already taken by someone else. The responsibility at work has to be the most important, if a worker doesn't have the responsibility in their job it will be a big problem, they might not care about the job and the things that their boss asked for. I would like to be the person who has the responsibility and all the interest of my job, and be proud of myself by doing the right things. Althought, I can learn day by day how to improve without advice of the manager and be the best worker in my area. Many people think that work is only to get money, and bored, and they are there just because they need to pay their bills, the main reason of work is to love what you like and enjoy doing it.
