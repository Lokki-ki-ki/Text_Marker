In my opinion, the idea to take off one day of school can have some benefits and some disadvantages, so is bad because in my opinion is a total change of schedules and students who work after school can have problems with that, other thing is, for me is not a big change if they want to save some resources and energy, but also can be good because the students and teachers rest more, and they can save a bit of energy. The students who have a job can have problems with their bosses, and it can make a more hard schedule for the student because they don't going to have any time to rest, and they can have troubles at school if they don't rest the necessary for their health and their concentration at school; other negative thing is because it's unnecessary because it's not a big change, if the school want to save energy one day don't going to make a big change and also, maybe it's okay as it's, and I think the original schedule with five days of school is good for all, and it doesn't make any problem, and the last negative thing I see is the hours of work of the teachers, the teachers maybe don't do enough hours of work and don't get the same payment and maybe can affect them in that way.This idea also have positive things like the chance for students and teachers to rest more or just for students, they have more time to do homework or work, other positive thing is to save a bit of energy and some resources, in some way the school can get benefit of these. The problem with the schedules and the save of energy and resources, are some benefits and disadvantages I thought for these theme and in my opinion it's not a good idea to change something what is already working with something who maybe not work very well and something who is don't give big changes.
