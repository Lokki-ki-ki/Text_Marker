An enjoyable educational activity. I think that an enjoyable activity for education will be a game y math like work in a group of 3 to 5 persons each person in the group to answer a question, if they get the question right they get a point but if they don't, they don't get any point, the group with more points get some candies for they element job doing what they are hate to do. I think this is a perfect activity because kids like to compete each other and is better when they know that if they win they get some candies. Another enjoyable activity will be in science, doing a project of how animals live what that ate and how they survive to the other animal to and give some important facts to the teacher, I think this project may be of two persons because a think this will be too easy for them and there may be some student doing the project by them self. I think that will like the project because they can get to know about an animal life and important stuff about it, and they can have fun with friends. I choose math and science because these are my favorites subjects and I enjoy doing them with my friends and my teachers my favorite part is when we get to work in group that is in science, but in math my favorite part is when I get a question right some time the teacher give me some candies.
