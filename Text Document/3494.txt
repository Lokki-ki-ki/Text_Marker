Is more essay when the person has determinate direction, when the person not have anything in the life, I think its necessary that person to be linked with family, friends who are motivation for him or she. My diary life is an example because my goals is taken my schools diploma but I need to work hard because, walk up 6 in the morning, separate breakfast for everything in my family, then I needed to take my thing necessary for my work, I working all day, to go out 5 pm then came for the schools night, I have for class for a year, sometimes I tired but, remember my family, what example given for my daughter, only work hard, to achieve my goals.
