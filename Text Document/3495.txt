Thomas Jefferson Prompt Thomas Jefferson once said, Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing." Jefferson wanted the world to become more active in life whether if it is a physical. Being active has many positives. Activity in society can help people reach their goals, help society, live life to the fullest, feel good and use time wisely. In this world people have big reasons to have activity life for example, they need one work where maybe all the time they are moved for these reasons and more I think that the people need one activity life. Small actions like recycling or participating in community this help to disperse a good life for you and for the other people because people look that you have one purpose in the life. The life is hard, you need activity, you need to learn new things all the time, and never you be an inactive person because if you are an inactive person you not have good reason for live in this world. Inactivity is not good for your dreams or goals in the life because if you have one dream about buy a sport car, the car is not coming if you not work hard to take the money for the sport car. Nothing coming so easy you need effort, and dedication the inactivity not help you, the essence of the life is to crate good reason of live and work for yours dreams and goals. The idle person is a person how not have activity, That person maybe not have dreams or goals or maybe your dream is being idle, but the point is that an idle person not have reasons for the society, not have support for your community, and he or she is lost in the life. For an idle all is for tomorrow not take actions today, not take effort and if you make this person not put the one hundred percent only put five percent. Remember you need to put effort to your activities in the work, school, sports and your life all need effort.
