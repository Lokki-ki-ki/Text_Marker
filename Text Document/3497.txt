First need to plan your work and need to be organized and have good details about what you need to read and need to wright. All what you have in your head just wright it all on paper first or then when you're weighting your book or story you will have everything in copy and can read it to make sure it's good. Like to the best teachers told me Generic_Name and Generic_Name if you write something on paper you will always be right or in the right path to do good on your book. Always need to write your work what happens if you brake your computer, but you have it on paper, so your teacher can just grade your paper. Paper is the best way to get your work and plan it out because they are your opinions and computer it changes the words to what it wants to change it to. Next you need to be organized if your organized you can read your work fast and so can the teachers if your work is neater your can do it faster because you read it and if you don't have time to finish pages in your computer you can darn the paper but not on the computer thing. Then if its organized you can use the same paper for next time but change some words or change the whole paper. You will need to do more work than just taring in the paper and not on the computer. Late you always need to be organized. After always finish you weighting don't leave it has way done just finish it to get done with the work you have to do because if you don't you will have to do way more work than what you have to get done just do your work on time. The end you will have to have everything done by the do date you have in school then you will do the rest of more work you have to get it done just do it.
