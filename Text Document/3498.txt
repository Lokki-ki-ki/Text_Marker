Would disagree for adding a one hour and a half hour because maybe parents might be worried about their child or children at school for another hour or two. I would say why would students want another hour of school if they just want to go home and see their family. I would even say that I would not want another hour of school cause isn't seven hours of school enough already. I can understand if teachers want to see their students even more maybe, but maybe they have to email their students parents before having to get the extra hour of school. What I would say is that all the students should vote online or in public to see if they all want to have an extra hour or half an hour still because it can't be the parents only because it's not fair for the adults to decide if they have to get another hour or two the students have to decide because they are the ones that are going to have the extra hour. Iunderstand that kids might want to do activities for their school, or they can stay after school to do it like, assignments, homework,projects, PowerPoints,tests, and quizzes. I usually wouldn`t want to have another because it's complicated sometimes doing stuff there, and it is just too much for me to handle at one time mostly and I have to do a lot of stuff at home also so i rather not have another hour of school cause it's a lot. If he or she doesn't want to stay they don't have to vote or say anything but other people might say something if they do want to have the extra hour or two I would speak up for himself or herself cause if u do want the extra hour or two go ahead vote or speak up for yourself and do your best to change the idea of the story or idea of the other people that would not have the extra hour. Now back to my disagreement about having another hour of school I would not have another hour of school because it is it much work for me to handle mostly cause the amount of work I have to do at school is so ridiculous really ridiculous cause the person or me has to write a lot form time and its worth it cause your getting a free education but i don't want a lot of education I would want to stay me and me only.
