Do you accomplish more when you always keep yourself busy? In this essay I will argue that keeping yourself busy serves a purpose. You get more things done, you will not be considered lazy, and you get to learn new things. When you are always doing something you get more things done and out of the way. You will not be behind on anything. This is a good habit to have because it can affect you in the long run. For example, when you get older and have to pay taxes or bills. You will be caught up and on time which is perfect for your credit score. You will not be considered lazy. Many people in your life will notice how you like to get things done. This habit will definitely get you a job. No employer is looking for someone lazy and does not like to do things. Keeping yourself busy can be therapeutic. Many people do this to relive stress or think about things instead of being useless. You will learn new things. Take advantage of the things you do because it can lead you to new opportunities. You can experience different things which is phenomenal. It is always fun keeping yourself busy because you feel great after the things you have accomplished. The more things you learn the more things you can try to keep yourself busy. Some people say inactivity serves a purpose, but they are wrong because when you are always doing something it keeps you motivated, experienced and makes a good habit to have. In the future I hope we have less useless people and more people who like to get things done.
