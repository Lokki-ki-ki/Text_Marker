I believe high schools students should not be expected to stick to a career, They are barely finding themselves. Choosing a career an at young age can lead to mistakes like choosing something you don't enjoy. High Schools Program should be a way to help the future professional to find what they are really want to be in the future, high school stage is one of the most important step for the young age students, Because there is when they choose their future, We need to work with them the best way is possible, We need to find out a program that impulse them to continue students after high schools graduate. In some case parents try to tell their children what career they have to take, In that case if the students have to choose a career by the time they are entering to the high schools, Most probably will be their parents chose what career they are going to take it, So that may be a mistake for the student because when they finally found themselves, Probably they realize there were something else more interesting for them that they could take it, At that time would be too late.Also, some students may take a career that doesn't make the money they were expecting, or choosing a career that's not fit for them, What the high school should be concerned about is to form the best professional for the future, Teaching them the best educations is possible and the same way showing them what kinds of career are there, The advantage and the disadvantage all the career have it. High schools programs should know they're playing a really important roll in the future of the country, However the programs needs to be concentrated, should be educated the young guys the best way is possible, Create a program to keep them away from problems like; Drugs, Alcohols, Gangs. These 3 problems are killing our new generation, This is one of the reason why the students leave the schools at early time. Also, the high schools needs to help the students to find the career that will make them be happy in the future. Should not be the high schools expected to the students to identify a career before or at the time there are entering to the high schools. In conclusion, high schools students, In my opinion are not ready to choose a career yet, At their age they may not know what really want, or be ready to make such a big decision.
