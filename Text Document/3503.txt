The Board of Teachers in a private school have said that, "The more early a student starts their way to a career, the less struggle is for them to accomplish it", because at their young age they have more time, fewer worries and not that much of responsibility, as a person gets older the more problems and responsibilities come to them, Although students also have many struggles in school, their house etc., is less than an adult, That is why teachers think that is better for a student to commit a career at a young age because they are less worried. The percentage of students that commit a career at a young age is high, many of these students received a scholarships others financial help, because of their behavior and their effort, The other half of this percentage of students have a well financial situation and there is no need for help or scholarships, although there is a low percentage of students that prefer to work instead of going to college, because of their financial situation, However many students with low financial situation have succeeded at their young age because of their effort to accomplish their dreams by working hard and knowing what they want to succeed in. Commiting a career at a young age could be difficult, or it could be simple, there are more students that had said that is a great idea, because your mind at a young age is involving in everything that surrounds the student, such as important information that would benefit him, as I said, the brain has more potential to store as much information as it can, because the student is young and is focus on its goals and there are no problems or thoughts that could distract the student. Other students had said that is a bad idea in a way of making the biggest decision, which is choosing what career you want to accomplish, because at that age they do not actually know what they really want. Parents and the societies have a big influence when students are choosing which path to go, some parents wants their kids to follow their steps, so they encourage their kids to take courses that would help them as they go, parents would always want the best for their kids more when it's about their future. Accomplishing a career at a young age brings many benefits, one of them is that the person no longer have to be thinking about it, takes a big weight off their shoulders, also the person would have more time for the family and especially the person would have many opportunities to find a job, because that person is young and lots of doors would be open for them. As we see committing a career at a young age has many advantages the biggest one is that, the students approach their goals and advance towards their great future.
