I think I'm going to agree what Churchill had said. Because, if i success so easily, I won't able to understand how hard to earn something. Some people think they are smart, and they'd never fail. But me, I thought a different way. I thought that if I fail,i'll have more experience. For an example, in my country, Vietnam, people always say that failure is the key lead to your success. I have failed many times in my life, but I never give up. I remembered when I was 8, I was really love the egg that my mom made for me. So I asked her how to make that egg, and of course I had broken a lot of eggs. And I also wanted to give up, but, I'm really love the foods that made from egg. So I continued learning how to cook the egg, and now I succeed with the fried egg dish. In my conclusion, I want to say that being a failure isn't a bad thing, because it helps me know that I can do better.
