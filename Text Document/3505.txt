The British Prime Minister Winston Churchill said "success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm". I agree with Churchill's statement because you have to work hard to be success, sometimes you are going to failure, but you have to try and try and never give up. There are a lot of obstacles to be success, you have to avoid them. Sometimes you are going to fell but do not give up. You learn from the failures. Churchill said that you have to failure to get success, if you failure you never have to lose enthusiasm. For example, if you want to go to college, and you do not have money to pay the college, you are going to feel sad because you can not do it, but you have to find a way to solve your problems, you can work and study at the same time, work to get the money to pay the college and then complete your career. To become successful, you have to work hard, do not give up, be positive, solve problems, try your best, and learn something new. Do not forget that success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.
