Benefits of working in a group is much easier than working all by yourself. For example, working with a group can help the students communicate with their classmates. They can also get a lot of work done by working in groups. Working with groups is such a good idea because the classmates can communicate with each other, take the stress away from working alone. For example, I have a lot of teachers who like to assign assignments independently and group work. It's a hassle for me to work on my own because I have a busy schedule after school. At times, I don't even get to turn in my assignment when it's due. When my teacher assigns group it's way easier for me because all of my classmates will get to get a job to do with the assignment, and we can work on it at school and be finished before the due date. It's also nice to go out of your confront zone and make new friends while working on assignments and an easy A. Being in groups knowledge you to understand better by your classmate. Example one day in history we had a project to do as a group, and I was completely lost on the civil war. I had to ask my classmates questions if they can help me, so I can understand better and get to do the work. Sometimes teachers doesn't know how to be specific, so it gets hard to understand. Seeking help from a classmate that's in your group is a good thing to do, and you learn more and becomes more understandable. Not a lot of students like to work in groups because their scared they have to do the work, however; if you communicate with your classmate and assign a job it will go easy on them and get the work done quicker and easier. In conclusion, working with groups its more beneficial instead of cramping in the work and not get it done.
