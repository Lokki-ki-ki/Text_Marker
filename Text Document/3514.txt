Thomas Jefferson once said, "Determine never to be idle...it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing." Being active like career goals and helping others and being inactive can lead to a lot of health problems. Do people accomplish more if there pursuing their own interest, or just being inactive also accomplish goals also? Being inactive can lead to health benefits, and also you're not helping yourself in life, also there is no purpose. If not being active can lead to an unsuccessful life. Just being inactive is bad in general, but people do have opinions on about it. Some people like to stay inside, not get a job, dropout of school, and Fisk of having an unhealthy body. Being out of contact of the world is bad, and it is very unhealthy to do that. Next is being active. It serves a purpose, and it benefits a lot in life like: maybe healthy body, pursing career goals, school goals, and helping others. Getting a job is good example of being active. Taking time out of the day to go accomplish anything that people are interested in is a good idea. People can pursue new learning skills in school or universities. Being active and getting goals accomplished is good in life. Having to participate in an activity will do good in life. As Jefferson said "Determine never to be idle...it is wonderful how much mat be dined if we are always doing". There will always be different opinions on being active and inactive but not everyone is the same in the world.
