On group works either at school, job or any other place or activity that you could do, sometimes you have the option of working with someone or multiple people, and you can also have the option of working by yourself, we all have our own opinion of either if we would like to do our work by our selves or to work with someone or multiple people for different reasons, and we can all have benefits or working with someone or working individually, and here are going to be reasons why it would be good to work either individually or in group. When we have the option of working individually or in group, some people may choose i different choice of how they would like to work for different reasons, some people may like to work in groups because they feel that may have more possibilities of talking to their friends or someone that they like, or they may feel that they work may get complicated or may take longer and that they may need help to accomplish it, so they would like to work in group to get help and to finish the work faster. Some people that would like to work individually may choose that choice because maybe they like to be alone and work by themselves, or maybe because they feel that they okay and that they don't need the help from anyone else to finish or do the work. In some cause on school, teachers sometimes don't like or don't prefer students working in groups because they want to see if they know how to do the work and if they can actually do it by themselves, or sometimes they worry that one person won't do the work and just let the rest of the people in the group do the work, or just do wherever the other guys are doing, or copy work from them, is true that it could happen in some occasions, but is not always like that, and the reasons why it would be good to allow students to work in group would be that, if every student knows how to the work, then every student can participate doing a different activity on the group and cooperate with anyone, or if the student doesn't know how to do the work, then he\she can get help from his/her partners to explain the/her how to do the work, and them she/he can be able to do the work, and they all can be able to participate in the activities. Has a conclusion, it would be better do work in groups, because in that way it could be easier to get the work done, because you can get help from others in the work, and it would be more fun because you can work with your friends at the same time that they do the work, and it could also be another way of how to meet people and make new friends when sometimes you have to work with people that you don't know, and for the people that like to work by themselves, maybe they should know all those benefits of working with people, but is they think that they have no problem working by themselves or that they can get the work done by themselves, then that should be okay to.
