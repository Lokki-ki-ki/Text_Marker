They say that conserving energy and resources, some business have a four-day work week consisting ten hours a day. Extending the school day two hours and a four-day school week ain't a bad idea for people who needs more help and are focusing on their future and college. Do you think this is a great idea? Yes, because the more time your at school the more time you'll be learning and getting help. If added 2 more hours to school on a four-day school week, the more school work will be finished and learned. I think my school should fallow this model because in my opinion test and quiz scores will show a greater improvement over time. First reason why my school should have a four-day week school with an extended 2 hours is because, many works can be done at school and teachers would have more time to explain details with deeper police. Teachers could have more time to study practice with the students before taking their test like using websites like Kahoot's. It/quiz lit. Live and notes, so the students can feel confident of what they have learned. This will be consisting longer periods for every class that every student and teachers will have to make sure every student leave the school grounds successful and informed of what they have learned that day. Second reasons are that being in school for 2 more hours will help you work smoothly at every class. Plus every student will be having a three day weekend from Friday to Sunday to rest and to have more time to complete homework and to study for testes and quizzes. I could get work done when I have not been in school because I was sick or on vacations to get back on track with my studies and school work. Great idea for people at school because they won't have any excess of loosing or not finishing work. Those are the reasons why a four-day school week is a fantastic idea with a 3 day weekend every day. And ways for students to be ready for college and to get good grades every time with extra help.
