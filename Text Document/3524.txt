I have being asked to explain the effects of a program involving pairing, older students, and younger students. Some schools have a program that pairs older students and younger students. I think that a program like that will be helpful. The older students are available to assist the younger students. This program can be helpful, to both the older and the younger students, because both the younger and older students, can learn new things from their opponent, or classmate. Also is fair that the older students assist, the younger students, so both of them can be successful. Like maybe the younger students can teach the older students, some new skills to 've learned in school, or somewhere else. Or maybe how they've learned to play baseball or softball. The older students can teach the younger students, how to do algebra / solving equations or how to ride a bike. Helping out younger students helping order students can be fun and can also turn out to be great. Or sometimes bad. Like for example, in my school, they have a club that both younger and older students can be in. It is free and not obligatory. So me and some of my friends, joined that club. And also some other students. Some older students, helped us, if we needed help, and we also helped them if they needed help. Every time during that club we each bring our own snacks or the teacher gives us some snacks himself, and we get to work. That club at school was so helpful for me and my friends, because we can get our homework done in time, and some older students or adults assist us if we need help. My friends and I also enjoyed that club because it was fun at certain time. In conclusion, pairing older students, with younger students, can be very helpful to certain people in need. Being kind a cooperating is the best thing to do while being in a club or working with younger and older students.
