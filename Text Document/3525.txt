Also, if we have that problem I think that being with teachers is the best idea because they help us a lot in the armies. The firs' reason is not all students have the internet in the houses some students don't have the internet because their parents don't have too much money to but one or maybe because they don't have the technology. One friend told me that their parents think that the technology is bad for him because it is distraction, and he needs to focus on his future. And if he doesn't take that class online he will fall that class. all parents think different. Another reason because not all student are not responsible. Some student came to school, but they don't do anything' but it is the teacher left them that they need to do this, they do it, because they feel pressure, and they know that the fall the class but is their class is online they will not care about the class, And they won't take care about the class. The conclusion is they bad idea take classes online because the internet is one of the things that they need it, and not all the students have it, they need to have their responsibility the class and not to all the student care for their classes, and the last thing is because not all the students like to have classes online because they know that they can't concentrate in their house because all the noise around.
