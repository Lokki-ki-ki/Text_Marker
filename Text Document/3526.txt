You think first impression would change a person or not? Some of are stuff that we have right now is because of first impression. In this essay I will argue about First Impression. Lets said that you go to the store and see something that you fall in love with at first impression, and you buy it, but is not what you expect to be as you saw in the store because the commercial lie about the product. Now you don't think the same about the product that you fall in love at first impression. First, I disagree about First Impressions statement. The feeling of first impressions everybody has it, but is not impossible to change it. I would give you an example of how your first impressions can be change. For example, you see a nice car for sale in you way home, and you stop by to see the car because you are in love with the look of the car. The owner of the car let you try it and when you get inside, car interior is ruined and a lot engine problems. Now your first impressions are ruined just like the car you thought look nice. Next weak you see another car for sale close to your house, but this time the car does not engine problem and ruined interior like the last car you try. Your first impressions from a car for sale change. Second, this is my experiences with first impressions. When I was 13 years old I thought that my sister phone have the best camera ever and best software ever. Now in 2019 the new iPhone 11 come out and my first impression with the camera and software was a lot different from my sister phone. In conclusion, I think first impressions can be change. Just try other placer where you can find the same product with the best thing. Your first impressions about last change.
