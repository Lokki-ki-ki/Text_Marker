I'm Generic_Name and my special skill/talent is that I am a competitor. I like to compete when it comes to certain things, because It motivates me to practice and work for what I want to achieve. I got my competitive spirit from my older brother. But I usually get competitive when it comes to video games or sports. But I also like to compete because I like to win. How did my brother make me competitive? He would always say that I would lose, and it would change my whole perspective of things. He would always win, so it would motivate me to practice. Me watching him practice would also make me competitive cause him practicing would motivate me to practice trying to be the best. He would also like to say that "you're going to lose" and it would change my whole mood. How does being competitive motivate me? It motivates me to practice, because it makes me want to be the best I want to be. It also motivates me more if I lose, because it makes me want to do the same thing again until I win at it. Watching my favorite sports motivate me cause it makes me want to be in those big leagues someday. My goal is to be a pro basketball player and I can't get there if I'm not competitive. Being competitive can get you a future in anything, and you should work on this skill. It will teach you life lessons, it will make you be successful, and it will teach you to work hard for what you want. You should have a goal set in mind and just go work hard and achieve that goal. Are you a competitive person? What's your goal so you can work hard at it and achieve it?
