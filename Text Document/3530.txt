Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm I think is a good idea because, you can be a successful person, you need to believe in yourself, and you need support of your family. You can be a successful person, because you can do all the things that you have in mind, and you can realize more than you already have, for example once my friend Generic_Name told me that her cousin Generic_Name he loves to fix computers, but he only can fix computers he can not fix telephones, TV, refrigerators and another electronics devices, and he was always sad because his goal was that he can fix all the electronic devices, he joins in a group of people that fix electronic devices, he always cries because he did not understand the things that he was learn, he was always try day to day, so one day he was the winner in the competition of who was the person that fixed one TV in the less time as possible, he fixed the TV in 1 minute, other people fixed in 10 or 5 minutes, finally he earns a diploma of the best fixed person, after 5 years he learns that nothing was impossible for him, in the actuality he has a store that he sell and fix electronic devices. The experience of Generic_Name is a good example in our life because he learns that never give up, he always fights for his goals and that example we can do exactly the same that Generic_Name always fight for our goals and always try another new things that we think that we can not do.Also, the reason that you need believe in yourself is that you always need to be positive person, every day see what are the things that you need for have success or what you need to do every day. In my experience I was in 10th grade was my first day of school at Generic_School, I was never with a lot of nervous, and I did not speak English, so all my classes in my first day of school I feel many eyes on my because I was the new student, then at the end of my day I take my correct bus and when I was at home talking with my mom I told her that I do not like the school because it was different of my schools on my country and my mom told me that with the pass of the days I will feel a good person, a correct person. So in my first year in the school I get all my classes with A at the end of my first year I earn one diploma in Math and four diplomas for each end of the quarter, so I pass 11th grade with excellent grades too, but sometimes I fail my classes my test in Algebra I fail many of the test, or sometimes I get D or F in my classes and when I fail something is when I was thought that I am not good in my classes or in English that was to hard learn the language English, all my teachers talk with me that I was a good student always complete my work, every day I was pay attention to my teachers, and then I pass to 12th grade this year is more difficult because I need to pass all my classes, all my ESOL and other things for example my WISE test, and now my teachers, my counselor, my mom told me that I am an excellent person, and sometimes I think leave the school and start to work because I feel that I cannot go to the end of High School. This is my experience and I believe that sometimes I am wrong because loss enthusiasm it is not a good idea always I will have failure or another experiences that are not good. And this is why we need to believe in our self if you do not believe in your self you may be you do not complete all your goals or all that you have in mind. Other people say that success consists of going from failure to failure and loss enthusiasm, but otherwise you need support of your family because the family is very important in your life, and always you need an opinion from your family. For example one day my uncleGeneric_Name he was in his college George Mason his family was in Mexico he was the only person that was in Generic_City. He always tries to do all the way correct and always be a good student and a good person, but one day he fails a very important test in the college that test was the final test in his College, and if he fails this test he can not graduate from College, and he was felt like a person that he can not do anything, and he told to his friend Generic_Name that he did not pass the final test, but Generic_Name said to Generic_Name that he can not tell to Generic_Name's family because they may be felt sad for Generic_Name, so the option for Generic_Name was that he was needed start one more time all the College, or he can pay extra money for retake the final test, but was a lot of money, so he decided that he was taking one more time all the College, but he does not see for support of his family, finally Generic_Name told to Generic_Name's family what happens with Generic_Name and why he still does not graduate from College, and Generic_Name's family talk with Generic_Name, and he tells the true and his family tell him that why he does not see for support in his family. This example is exactly to explain for why the support of your family is very important, the family is the first group of people that we need to tell them always the true, and they will have an excellent opinion about what you're asking them. In conclusion, loss enthusiasm when you are failure it is not a good idea because can be a successful person, you need to believe in yourself, and you need support of your family. And always think about what are the things that you are complete or for what you need these goals. Also, think about that if you failure you need keep going and never give up because if you feel that you can not do anything all your life may be your will think that you not are a good person in something that you have in mind. Finally think about all the good things have a successful person and how you can do like a successful person what you need to do or what materials you need for be a successful person.
