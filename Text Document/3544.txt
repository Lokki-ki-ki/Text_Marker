Today, we talk about the career for student at a young age. Are the student need to commit to a career at a young age ? Is it a good idea ? The answer is yes. They need to know what they want to do when they grow up. Their course of study in high school will help them to choose what career they think they suppose to do. They have to focus to what career they choose and they going to fathom out that career. Example, when a student want to be a doctor when he grows up that's why he has to focus to learn well biology and all about the doctor's job. If we don't show them what they need to do or like to do, they gonna lost outside the world. They don't know what career they need to follow, and they are not going to have a good job. We going to ruin their life indirectly. So that we should teach them about career and guide they to the right way. We love our student that's why we should support they to have a better life in the future. That's all of my opinion. I hope we don't make any mistake because everyone deserve a happy life. Thank you all.
