Can you imagine someone that want to study more and to get more knowledge? Well, many people do want to continue studying because the more knowledge you know, you will have a more benefit in your life. Furthermore, like the Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote "Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow." He's because we never stop learning the little things in life such as: explore the world and to never stop your dream of continue your study. I agree with Emerson's statement because we want to get in our goal in the survey and to never stop growing with mentality. First reason is that we have to explore the world. For example, by exploring the world we will now like the different cultures of each country or by having friends that are different country. Like my mom always said "You have to get out of the box to learn more, to see and explore what you have at your surroundings". Second, to never stop your dream of continue your study. For instance, if you want to grow mentally you have to study more to get the knowledge you want. The more knowledge you have, then the more great will be your job or even better you can be your own boss. However, people will never grow if they don't continue their survey.Finally, as you can see, Emerson's statement "Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow" is true because we will never stop learning, and the more you study, the more knowledge you will know.
