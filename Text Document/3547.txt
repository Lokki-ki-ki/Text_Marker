I think this is benefiting being able to stay at home and do online classes sounds good. I agree because doing online class it goes on your own paste and you won't feel to rushed to finish, another good reason would be doing online is that you don't have to show up to school anymore so you'll get to sleep in and wake up whenever. My final reason is if someone is decides to go to college they'll be ready because that's how college is online. Think about not being able to have time to finish your work and your teacher saying you only have 25Â mins or by the end of class everything needs to be finished? Well that won't have to be the case anymore because doing online means you'll be going at your paste and you won't have to rush to turn things in. For example, I take an online class, so for me, I already know how it works, and honestly I think it's way easier because no teacher is yelling at me to hurry about or I don't have to turn in incomplete work. So I like doing the online class is also fun because I be at home while doing my work in my bed. Rough day at work, and you know you have school the next morning? Well no worries because you get to sleep in and do you school work from your bed. That's right, don't have to wake up early and go to school. Just chill at home in your bed and do your work. That's why I agree that we should have online classes because I'll enjoy my bed and do my work from home. Finally, last but not the least college. If you ever plan to go to college then best believe that college is online class and video conferencing. Nothing new go to the library and study from there who wouldn't like that.? In conclusion online classes and video conferencing is the best way of learning. Yes they benefit from learning, and it helps them out.
