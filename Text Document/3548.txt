Should people make their own decisions, or should they follow, others experts and authorities about life's experience. However, from what think if you are alone out of nowhere, and you don't have any experience is much better because you get to have your experiences and no one bothers yours plans. You make your own decisions and follow your own rules. On the other hand if you have someone on your back that do have more experiences them you will be correcting you and bordering bothering you. Some people think that is better to follow someone decisions, but others think that is better to be alone because you must create your own decisions and follow yours rules is like you have a family no one is going to correct what are going to do with your family you don't follow others people they may be incorrect, and you are correct and is better to be alone because you make your on family with your decisions and your rules. To begin alone is better because you make your experiences from the mistakes. You make your own decisions, but went you make a decision that coast you a mistake you get to have more experiences from the mistake that you did and went you have experiences from the mistake you learn from the mistake that you need to be more responsible went you have a mistake you get to have a big experience and that make you more strong and what you do and that makes you feel good, and you become more responsible from the things that you do form the experiences that you have some people see that, and they will have a hope on you and that you are going to be someone in the future, and they will know you better because you are alone and not with someone that has more experiences you will raise you and your decisions. Another think is that you must follow your own rules that you make. When you make your own rules no one is going to say some think to you, they will follow your rules if they want to be with you however if you are with someone that has more experiences you must follow their rules and you don't want that to happen went you make your own rules and follow your rules you will know what is going to happen but if you follow someone else rules you must be aware because you don't know what is going to happen, so is better to make your decisions your rules because you know that is good from what are you going to do so make your own rules and follow your own rules don't follow someone else rules you become stronger and more smart person. Fanally the last reason why you should be one is that no one is going to bother you will make every thing in your hands and no someone else hand they will not be on your back bothering you will make every thing possible on your hand and if you are alone you will become and expert on the job, company,schools the things that you do you will be the head on your decisions, and you are not going to use someone else head and if you use their head they will correct you in what you do and if you do is like from what they think is better they will be bordering you and that is not too good because it will be bad why it will be bad? Because they will make where do you walk in a way that you must don't want to walk they will make every thing possible to walk in their way, and you want to walk in your way their will make every thing possible they will bother you and no you must follow your way and your road to make every thing possible to have your own experiences and your own rules. To conclude people must make their own decision, they should not be with someone else that has experiences or some TIPE of company you must star from zero and trow the process you will get to have some experiences from the mistakes that you did while you where working and went you have more experiences you will get to be more strong, and you will grow in the things that you know, and some people look at you, and they will have a hope on you that you will make it to the end. On the other hand you must create your own rules you must be very organic on the rules that you make don't follow others person rules make your own rules and went you make your own rules you must know what is going to happen if every thing is going to be okay or bad, but if you follow someone else rules you will not know what is going to happen do must make your own rules, so you can be unique and an expert. In addition, if you are alone no one is going to bother you in the things that you make because you are alone you are the boss no one is going to some something to you, and you will guide others people went they see that you are alone and no with someone else you will grow a lot in the things that you do. Finally you know now that the best thing is that you should be alone and no with someone else that they will make your own rules, and you will learn from their experiences, and you will not get to have your own experiences and no one is going to bother you is you are alone because of hall of that you must be alone and star from were, Thanks.
