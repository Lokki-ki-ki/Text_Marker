"Hip hip hooray!". "That's a talented kid!". The whole school cheering for you after you made the winning shot for your school to win the whole basketball game. Imagine the enormous crowd enjoying your performance. One talent I have is using math every day. Some people do not use math as much as I do. I use it when I go to the store, at school, and at home. Math is one of the things I use every day. I use math when I am at the store because I have to calculate my money and how much I will be using. I develop this skill from school because I have use math is most my whole school career. Some individuals might think my talent is unusual, but I think that my talent is helpful in the real world. I would rather spend my life as a math expert than just staying at home and doing nothing. I want to succeed right now, so I can become a well-educated and successful adult. In addition, another place I use math is at school. This is the place where I developed this skill. Teachers have an excellent job making me the person I am today. For instance, I am doing my project and need to get the dynamics right I use make to help me with the project. I would like to become a math teacher at my school. Math is all around us, but you just don't notice it. Moreover, the last place I use math in is at my house. I use it in dividing my chores with my siblings and I use in the kitchen when I am measuring ingredients. I also use it when I do my homework. It helps me when I am playing basketball because you need an arch to make the ball straight in. It helps when I am older because I would already know how do math and know how to use in the real world. In retreat, there a variety of talents, but my talent is using math every day at home, at school, and at the store. I use math almost every day of my life. Math has been a huge part of my life.
