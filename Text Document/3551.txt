People should follow their own instincts and ideas. First if people disagree with what people are saying then they can say what their idea is and put it to a vote to see whose ideas better. Second if people ideas are being ignored then the people ignoring are taking away their freedom of speech. Third people should have the right to say if their idea is good or not. However, people are being ignored and not having a chance to speak and have to listen to someone ideas instead of standing up to people and telling them their ideas to see if people would agree. If authorities doesn't let people put down their ideas then they are breaking the law of freedom of speech and denying people to speak and say what's on their mind. Finally, people should have their voice heard and follow their instinct and ideas instead of being forced to listen to someone else's idea.
