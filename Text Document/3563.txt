Disneyland is the place I would want to explore! Have you ever heard the saying" Disneyland is your land?'' Well I would like to explore the nights with marvelous fireworks, and blasting shows. Disneyland is a great place, for kids that enjoy watching Disney movies and/or shows. At Disneyland kids would enjoy the shows, fireworks,and rides! A family would see the look at their kids face after a fantastic night of fireworks mashed up with fantastic plays. Therefore, I would like to go out to Disneyland to view the huge castles with decoration, and visible lights that would just glow my night up!. In sum, Disneyland would be my elected place because I love, and enjoy watching Disney shows, and love to see people act out as Disney characters. In additional, Disneyland is my dream place to go because I get to watch my favorite shows, and enjoy myself! However, my way of explaining Disneyland is... Imagine yourself playing your favorite sport or your favorite hobby. In this example I'll be using hockey. Let's say you just love being offense since your perfect at it, and always help your team to win with your blossom hits. Therefore, since you would love hockey (defense), and I love watching plays both would connect to form a connection which would be a joy of winning in hockey, and a joy of watching people preform plays. In conclusion, you love to play hockey, and I love watching plays which all leads to a great night of our favorite shows/sport optimistically that will be unforgettable.
