It has been said that having a positive attitude is the key to success life. I agree but at the same time I disagree. First being positive can bring success in life we so many great people who found the key to success in being positive like Micheal Jordan. He was cut from his varsity basketball team but him being positive and putting in work help he found the key to success in his life. Next my second reason I think being positive can be the key to success is. The Baby he was always told we aren't every going to be anything but had stayed humble and positive and keep his head up, and now he is one of the top rappers of are time now. He has multiple gold and platinum records, and he has millions of fans and followers he has people who want to see him because he stayed positive and found his key to success. Last I disagree because having a positive attitude isn't always the key to success because when the people out in war doesn't have a positive attitude because they have to be ready for the enemy and I think you wouldn't want to have a positive mind set in that predicament. In conclusion being positive can sometimes be the key to life and sometimes not having a positive attitude can still be the key to life.
