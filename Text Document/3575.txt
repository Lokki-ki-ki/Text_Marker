I disagree with Emerson statement about individuality, because you can't think about only yourself, I sometimes mean but not every time like me, me, me and nothing else based yourself. So you have to think about others like; family, parents, brothers or sisters, grandparents, colleagues (sometime), friends when they're helping me in some situation and after that I do care. For example if you are in team or more than that, when you participate your members may ask question to solve the problems, what are the planes for next few weeks we will do, or projects. And "it's about teamwork not a selfish" if you decide to ignore and don't even trying to help your team members, what kind of person they will think about you as team member, but if you will help your team, well then.... push yourself and at least do your best to succeed. When you have a job at business office or somewhere else, they will watch you how you behave, why they should higher you, Handel your working etc. Just don't overthink about yourself, and just do not forget about other who you have.
