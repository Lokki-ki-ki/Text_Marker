If you challenge yourself, you will never become good at something you want to do or achieve it. Others believe that challenging yourself won't improve your growth. It's only going to make people struggle. Myself, however, agrees because putting yourself to a challenge can make people explore or learn many things. That is how many people become so talented at things they do now. Going beyond can raise your confidence higher. My first time experiencing playing the flute was very difficult. The more time I practiced the notes and songs, the easier it got for me. After a while, I wanted to play a different instrument. The second instrument option for me when I began playing the flute was a violin. It was more difficult than playing the flute, but eventually I got used to it. The more things anyone can accomplish, the more challenges there will be to be completed to improve growth. School is a good example of improving yourself. There are specific kids who have disability in learning called Special Ed. The experience of being in self-contained classes were easy. For the kids who are capable of being in a larger group class have to make growth in order for them to be in a co-taught class or regular classes. I've got out of self-contained classes by making so many improvements to show that I don't need to be in self-contained. Going beyond can make a big difference. Going beyond the goal is a great feeling because the goal is achieved and then the on to the next level.
