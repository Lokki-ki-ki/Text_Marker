Do you think first impression is difficult to be change? Some people said that first impression is difficult to change in a person. Firs impression can be change in some people because you can be related to the person, You can talk to the person if it is having a bad time, sometimes you can change the first impression to a person. When I was in middle school I meet a girl, her name was Generic_Name, I didn't like her first impression and I noticed that she didn't like my impression too. She was my harbor for 3 years, and she didn't talk too much, and she was always angry. One day I notice that she was having problems with friends, like me. We were relative to some things and our first impression. Sometimes people can be having bad times and that is why their first impression it seems difficult to change. I had a friend that it was having a bad day at work the first time I meet him. Generic_Name was angry, and he didn't talk to me that day. After that day I was surprised of his impression. Days after he explains what was happening to him that day. If you meet a person more closely you can change their first impression. You can become a friend to the person, sometimes they change. You would like more that person than the first time. Like I said before, they can have bad times the first time you see their impression. Not everyone is happy every day. First impression is not difficult to change, people can do it and people can change it. Some said that is impossible to change first impression, but is not, if I can do it with some people, you too can change it. In the future we will see that first impression is not impossible to be change.
