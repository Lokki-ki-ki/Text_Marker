What is your favorite thing to do during your free time? Do you stay in bed and watch movies? Do you go to your community library to read books and study? Or do you just go outside for a walk? Studies have proven that 75% of people go to parks more often during their free time. These specific people say they usually go outside to relieve stress, and get their mind off things. This is one key factor to why you see elderly people outside. But our main focus was on modern day children and why they love going outside. Children always want to have fun, but usually with their friends. Additional to this fact, they start to create games and activities with their friends giving them a chance in looking forward to going outside every day. One popular game from the 1800s is hopscotch, which is surprisingly still played today. Though this game was only played by girls, through recent years we start to notice not only girls but boys and adults playing this game. Though hopscotch isn't a really competitive game and can be played alone, it's better when it's played with other people. Another game played much more often is freeze tag, or tag, which consists of two teams and two catchers and played by both girls and boys. This game involves running which can improve both your physical well-being and cardio-respiratory endurance, This game isn't usually played by adults as seen in frequent surveys, and tend to be a child only game. This game is one of the most competitive outdoor games played my modern day kids. Comparing these two games, there is a high chance that people who enjoy running would go for tag, and serene people would go on tho playing hopscotch. Though you could still play tag being a quiet person. These are some examples of what to do when you ever want to go outside, or to the park.
