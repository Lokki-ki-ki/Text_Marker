Students should commit to a career at a young age?. Many people thing that this would be an advantage in the future, because if many students choose a career when they are young, then there's going to be more professionals that can help the country, but other people thing the opposite, because they think that the students are not ready to choose a career, because they are not in the age to thing by themselves. In my opinion, I would say that both arguments have good reasons to support their arguments, but l would prefer to be disagreed with this opposition. For my first reason, I would say that it's too much responsibility for their age, because they don't have the experience necessary to complete a career that they like, but they are not prepared to complete, however if they choose a career, then they have to worried about the college that they want and how much it's going to cost to them and their family to start a career, also because they are not going to take the career seriously, and it's going to be a waste of time in a career that they can not hold by themselves, so they are going to leave the career. In addition, my second reason is that they don't have the ability to maintain a career mentally, because they can not control their actions and thinking, and if they do things wrong, and they try to solve their problems alone, it's going to be stressful for them, what can cause a distinct kind of future that they don't expect, so they can get affect by all the things that can occur on your way, and also because there's going to be people that instead of help you, it's going to use for their benefits, and one example of that is the people who work in factories, construction, and business. Finally, my last reason talks about how much time they have to enjoy their life, if they have to work in their career at a young age, because you can choose to be a professional when you are young and find jobs with that kid of career, but if you already know that you are going to work almost the rest of your life to have better future and keep progressing, so why don't enjoy your youth and be happy doing things that you like, instead of worry about find a career that if you are not ready, it's going to make you problems that you don't want to have now. In conclusion, supporting with the reasons, I would like to say that the best thing to progress in life, is to find something that you are good, that you can control, and also something that you can make money with that, however if you know what you want to do in the future, and you know how you are going to try to make it possible, why don't enjoy what you have now, and leave the occupations for later, so you can concentrate in what you want now, before it's start to being late, because life is only one, and we have to enjoy the maximum as we can.
