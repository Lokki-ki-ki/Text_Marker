We live in a world where everything revolves around technology. People these days don't know what the world outside holds. Why? Because they always have their noses in their phones, and they never take time to go outside. Very few people know what it's like to actually spend time outside. Sports are another example, not only are they fun, but they are also helping you stay healthy especially if you play almost every day. If you think about it every sport requires you to run or to keep moving. Sports can also be something you do after dealing with a lot of stress or work. They were shown to be a good for both your body and your mind. Families also become closer when they spend time together with no sort of technology that can distract them. I think now in days families aren't as close as they used to be because we spend too much time on our phones and not so much on the people who care about us. Technology has advanced a lot in these past years, and it is fine that people want to explore new things. But we shouldn't get lost in it and forget that there are other things waiting to be discovered beyond a tiny screen. Activities like sports bring you better things than a tiny screen can.
