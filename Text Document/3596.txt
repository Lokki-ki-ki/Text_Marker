My school should follow this model by extending the school day two hours, and four-day school week. There are some benefits but also disadvantages. First reason, if we take only two hours of class during the day probable should more express try the best of us, for use that time of class. In contrast, lose hours in others things not necessary; with more hours and days off the students would be distracted of the responsibility that is demanding the school. Second reason, less pressure for the students that have a job is a big idea taking the school day two hours, because they want time for both during the week. For example, I work 27 hours in three day I came home so late, hungry, and tired sometimes I miss days of school, for that reason I think is benefit take time on sleep then came to the school just for few hours. But, one disadvantages that could be happen is less time of classes when the students don't work or spend time in others distraction. Clearly, they feel more in liberty in do something else on free time, and would not put all in the study. Third reason, another disadvantages is not focused at all maybe should not work that idea; in the way that lost time of school is lost sacred time. The teachers miss day of their job too, and the student do not see the loss of the opportunity that is the school. However, one benefit and important for the students is the repose, so when our brain is in repose with not too much pressure it was relaxed, and we're going to be blessed. Because, we have more time to think much better what we want to do for our future, so we think most clear. In conclusion, in my opinion it is a great idea if my school take a four-day school week of two hours each day. Obviously, it's probable that students feel easier in this way, for making their homework with time, wisdom, and decoration. Finally, the school will make the change for a good reason.
