I believe that students would work more effectively online rather, then sitting in a classroom all day and not engaging in there learning rather than talking to their friends and being sociable. When working online the student and teacher has obligations that he or she would complete Food example a student that has a project due on Wednesday and will do it, on time and correct rather than the student, that goes to school and has the same project due on the same day there will be, higher chances that the student working online will have it done first because the student has less time, to socialize with friends and has more time to stay focused on he's or her work. Many kids have this advantage, and it is a good one because they learn so much though out an online school rather than a public school ; because the class it more advanced and has for advantages for example the student ;online is taking pre calculus the student can easily tell the teacher what problem he or she is stuck on, and the teacher can go over it explaining it in more it also helps the student to be more engaging in there learning ; turn details rather than asking the teacher after class and not giving you a straight forward awnser. Many student's taking classes online have the capability and asset of graduating much earlier because there classed are more advanced and with more potential to succeed in life because of the parents and the disposition that they have enrolled there kid in to online school, rather than regular school. Many parents do benefit from this great advantage because the student can take a class knowing that the parent will give support to the kid in his or her future career.
