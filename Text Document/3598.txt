I agree with the statement because when you get your first X box game the impression you have is almost impossible to change. That impression can be almost impossible to change because you are so happy that you could burst into tears, but that impression can also be embarrassing, when you realize it you can change your that impression and make a different impression to an impression that is less embarrassing and they could be OK for you, but the first impression is the best impression of you being happy about having you first X box game and that impression can be OK for you if you like. You can choose not to change that impression because it is the impression that makes you feel good about your self even if that impression can be embarrassing it is no problem for you because it's your impression and no one else impression. So I agree that first impression are almost impossible to change.
