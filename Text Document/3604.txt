Have you ever wonder how our character is formed? John Lubbock once wrote," Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it." I personally think that our character is formed by our friends, social media, and so that people can like us. Many people believe that we choose our own character by being ourselves and not caring what anyone thinks however, I think that our character is formed by our friends since were always with them. For example, if my friends are always skipping school, and they ask me to skip school with them, and I am going to say yes since, they are my friends. What most do us do is, that we can not say no to our friends and by saying yes, it makes up our character because now people see us as a person who skips school. Another reason on why our character is influenced by other people is, because of social media. Social media plays a big part on how our character is formed. For example, on social media there are a lot of models, and singers. A lot of young teens want to be like them, so they will change the way the look and act. Since society has made it seem that if you don't look like Kylie Jenner or any other famous person that you're not pretty and because, of that people want to change their character. Finally, our character is formed by who we are around is because we want people to like us. For example, if I am at school and I want to be friends with a group of girls I will do what they like and do what they do all the time so, that they can like me. Since I want them to like me I will end up changing my personality and look just so that they can like me; this makes my character be influenced by others. I urge you to think about your character if it's formed by the way you choose or if it is formed by whom you surround yourself with. We should not let people choose how they want our character to be. I personally think that our character is formed by our friends, social media, and so that people can like us.
