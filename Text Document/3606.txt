Have you ever wondered about your working skills do you prefer working in groups or on your own? How they benefit you in your job or anywhere else?people say that working together is a better way of doing stuff then just working alone. But theirs other people who prefer working alone. Here are some of the benefits to both sides. I feel like working in a group is more beneficial because it lets you have a chance to ear new ideas. You can also finish the work faster if everyone is doing something. For example this one time. My friends and I were doing a project for drives Ed. We had some time to think and write down ideas. After that all of us got together and agreed on some ideas. Then we each had our own part to do, and we finished it during class. Some people believe that working alone is better. You can be more focused on you work. In addition you can be more creative in your own way. I remember this girl in my biology class had to do her finial exam project. She decided to work by herself. The girl was res reaching and was really focused on that she was looking for. She got her information then made a really creative poster that went with the theme of the project. The teacher loved it and gave her an A for it. In conclusion working in a group benefits me the most. There is less work to do. Everyone has good ideas. You get to express thoughts and feelings about your topic. So many more things that working alone doesn't give.
