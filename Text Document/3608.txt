I agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson because people in this world want you to be another person that yourself. I have two examples, my family want me to be another person that my self, and the second example is if you want to be yourself in this world you will never find a job; You have to be another person the want you to be. I start with my family; How I said my family they don't like when you try to be yourself, they want you to be what they said, like jobs for your future they want me to be something the don't want to be like: Soldier, Fireman, Lawyer, and president; I want to be someone else the don't like too much, they don't like when I think in my self just what they want, they think if you are someone else you will have a big accomplishment. In the case of jobs if you try to be yourself, and not what the company want you will never find a job; To happen to me a lot of times when I try to apply to a job, they want you to be another person with different expression like: happy, active, team work, and accurate; If you are opposite of the expression you will never find a job with the expression the have, so you have to be like the company want you to be, and they would give you the job, then you will have a big accomplishment from the company because you are someone else. That's why I agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson, we live in a world the people don't like when you are yourself, and they like when you are someone else; I don't think the accomplishment is just for be someone else and not yourself, if you try hard when you are yourself you will have the greatest accomplishment in life and for people who don't believed in their self like: Family, company, manager, people, and you; If you believed in yourself everything will be good and the accomplishment would be often.
