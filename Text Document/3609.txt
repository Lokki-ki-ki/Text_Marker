I agree that failing plays an important role of success. Is because you can learn form your miss tack, you can understand why your keep failing and fix the problem, and you don't make a same miss tack again. However, I do see why some people don't think the same way. It because they don't want to take a risk to fail at anything and no one want to admit that they failed on something. But it not as bad as you think, hears why. First, everyone my miss tack and you can learn from that miss tack. For examples, when I failed to shoot a goal, I what to know why I keep missing a goal. After a weal I learn how to properly shoot it. A nuder example are, my friend like to draw a person, but he always has a problem to draw a hand. He tries to learn why he keeps failed to draw a hands and time go by, he finally learns how to draw a hand. Then, you can understand why you keep failing and fix the problem. For insteps, I always keep failing to palates, so I understand what was a problem and trying to fix that problem. A nuder example are, when I keep reading I always keep miss pushing it. So I am reading thirty mines every day, and it helps me. Lastly, you won't make a same miss tack again. For examples, when I found out that I failed my reading test I what to know what part that I miss, when I toked again I pass the reading test. A nuder example are, when I made a miss tack to get a figure that almost filthy baler, and at the same time I have to pay my bills. So I learn my miss tack, at the time when I pay my bills I won't get a figure that almost filthy baler. Inconclusun, failure is not as bad as you think, it can help you to success for insteps you can learn form your miss tack, you can understand why your keep failing and fix the problem, and you don't make a same miss tack again. I hope you understand why failing plays a big role of success.
