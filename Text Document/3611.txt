Success is about to be enforced our self and to accomplish our goals, as I know nobody was born knowing something everyone was born to learn and to fail every time that is possible to learn more However I agree with Churchill's statement that is about the important role that failure plays in the success, My reasons are that we can protrude, influenced others, more personal experience. My first reason is that everyone can protrude and be proud over our self, and protrude means to take the best of us and show it, for example, in my case lass year I lost my job because I didn't have enough age to work in the company this year I start my own company and I have my own employees, this is an example how failure didn't take my enthusiasm, and that we can lose twice maybe but not forever because be will be success later. My second reason is that our attitude is everything we can infuse others that have been losing their lives and their enthusiasm and show them that everyone can enforce and get what they want, A example will be my cousin she had been in 12 grade for 3 years that at the first year that she didn't pass her grade herself confidence went down, and she had loss her goals, but this year she will graduate because this year she is being preparing to pass her classes and to get her diploma, this is an example of been failing, and failing and then get the success.Others might say that success and failing isn't good for our society, however I still disagree because to get success or to win we have to learn from the beginning, my third reason is that with the experience what we have of been losing and failure twice and twice we will know that we are going to do and be successful later. According to a quote that say ''You can lose a battle but not the war'', In fact we can lose everything but not our enthusiasm. In conclusion, this is why I agree with Churchill's statement that is about the important role that failure plays in the success, My reasons are that we can protrude, influenced others, more personal experience. Everyone is exerted to failure but what we have to do is to continue and don't surrender don't give up with our goals, always been happy doesn't pay attention to the situation.
