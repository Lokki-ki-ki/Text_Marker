Some people are not agreed with the Summer break, because is too short. They said that the Summer break needs to be change, and they need to take out spring break too, because they spring break can be used to do SOL. The need to star the Summer in June and end in August. May is too early to go out of school. The schools need to take out spring break. If they take out spring break we could have more time and to the SOL in that week that they take out. In April, we shut have more fun activities in schools and class. The school can take the time to test us in that week or have more time practicing for the SOL. They shut change the summer to June and August. May is too early to go out of school for summer in May sometimes is cold and not that hot and in June is perfect to go out of school because the sun is hot and ready to go to vacations with you family and friend and to have more fun. The school shut take out the spring break only because it is close to summer and student could have more time to take the SOL, To study more for your final test and have more time in the classed that you have, and the teacher can help you more and teach you more schools shut have more activities in that week for the students to have fun and learn at the same time. More sport and new abilities for the student and teachers to have fun. To have more trip to go see musics and university and the art museum etc. So we are agreed with the people said that the schools need to change summer and spring break so that we can have more time in school and more time for summer 3 months for summer and 0 weeks for spring more time to have for the SOLS and study for the final test.
