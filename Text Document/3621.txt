However, he was killed because of whom he shows up to be, and it's here where we see that it does not matter what impression you show up with, people don't mind about it, we all live in a world that only care for our own good, our on benefits. I don't agree in first impressions are impossible to change, I've met people that I use to hate now they are part of my life they're my family. Independence Day, you have a job interview, the first thing they get about us, it's first impression no matter what we do and present to be someone that we obviously aren't they only care about your eagerness, charisma, garment, manners, etc. The popular one meeting new people at school at the beginning we can hate everyone but until we don't meet that person we won't change our perspective about its personality. In fact, most of us guide by first impressions, and that's the same towards us. Primaly get can easily get impressed by someone or completely disinterested.
