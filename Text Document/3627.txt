Students should be allowed to bring cell phones to because maybe some students may have an emergency, and they need to call there parents, or if there parents had an emergency, or a car accident a need to call her child to make sure they aren't picking them up after school. And maybe they need there cell phones if they walk to school, and they kidnapped them, and they need to call someone to help them.that's why the principal should allow the students to bring cell phones to school and turned them off in call.They can use there cell phones in lunchtime only but to make sure they have them off in class. And in the hallway they can use them just for an emergency or if a kid faints someone can call the nurse to come for him that. Student show
