When you try something that already you have done, and that thing didn't work, don't be worry about that because than more time you're trying to do it you will get more strong and have control by your self, always keep strong and keep the calm, and belief that you'll be a great person and all the doors will be open for you. Trying new things helps you to understand that you can do more things, everything depends on you if you really wants to do something that you like, just do it, never do the opinions of others people because is only you, the people can't control you life everything. The thing that you have already done, and you are doing and everything was wrong, what the Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote is not right because doing something that you have already done, but you didn't get it that's doesn't mean that your life is done, or you will never grow that's wrong, when you're sure that what you want you'll be fairing for that thing that you'll lose for many times, but you'll be fairing for that, and you'll not get tired until you get your dream. My father is a singer, and he's very strong, and he really knows what he wants, one day he participated on one big project about music, he was a perfect singer but on the day of the presentation he completely loses his voice, but he won the presentation trying he's best, when he won many people tall him that they wanna to do a big different project with him, and now he is a big star, and he grows a lot, thatâ€™s means that if you try something you'll grow a lot because you have to belief and be very sure what you want and if you see is you like, never give up just like me, when I came to United Estates I didn't speak any English, and it was difficult to stay here and don't know any English all my homework and my project was difficult, but I didn't give up and I'm steel growing a lot and I have been trying a lot a thing and I steel growing. Many people think that if you're so expert and mastered you'll have a perfect future, but some people think that the more time you're trying to do the think that you want you'll miss time on your life because the only thing that it's important to you is that think that you really want. Some people try a lot a thing but if they didn't get, and they fail and some of they stop what they wanted, but some of them keep trying and trying their best to get what they want, always try your best and don't give up, when your families or friends tell you that you will not grow more or nothing's don't believe that because you're stronger that you know just keep doing and if you're an expert doing that thing you like you'll grow a lot because you have to demonstrate to the people that who you're what you can do. Steel faith for that and I'm not agree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson is wrong just keep wronging and never stop everything depends on you.
