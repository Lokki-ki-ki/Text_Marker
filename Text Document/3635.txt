The greater danger for most of us is setting our aims too high and falling short because many people try to aim for something that's impossible for them to accomplish, falling short on your goal will make you want to give up, and not having the motivation and energy will get you nowhere. Most of us should set a realistic goal for them to aim; but sometimes we aim too high and set an impossible goal that we can't accomplish it. For example: some people aim to be perfect; but that's impossible because no one is perfect. Some people will do so much work for no reason because if they don't have the materials or a plan for that impossible goal TH, en they're wasting their time. The danger of this is that no one will accomplish a single goal if they're aiming to high. Many people try to get the results that they want; but many falls short. Falling short on a goal can be a big danger, because it could lead many people to calling themself a failure. This can also make people want to give up on what they were aiming for. Everyone wants to be successful in life and not a failure, because if you're a failure, then you'll face many challenges and suffer. Many successful people in the world accomplish their goals because they have the motivation and energy on doing better; but many people don't have a motivation or energy that they get nowhere in life. Motivation and having energy are some keys that can help people aim for something big and be able to accomplish their goals. Another way people can aim big or be successful with their goals is if they have a positive mind set. The great artist Michelangelo once said, "The greater danger for most of us lies in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark." Setting your aims low and achieving your marks is not the great danger or a danger. However, setting your aim too high and falling short is a great danger because you can learn from it.
