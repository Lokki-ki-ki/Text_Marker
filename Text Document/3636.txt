Many people prefer to work in a group, because they think it can be more helpful, and others people said that they prefer to work alone. There are some benefits of working in a group and working alone. I think that the best option is to work in a group. When you work in a group you can finish faster. For example, if there is a group of three people, one people can be doing a job, while you are doing another, and the third people can be doing another. That is a smart and easy way to finish the work faster. Working in the group can be very helpful for planing how to do a project. Like as, all the people in the group gives their opinion of how to do the project and everyone in the group hears the ideas and them, they vote for the best idea in the group. That is a key point of working in the group everyone express them self and the work become easily. In a group you can have better ideas. For example, you are in a group, and you have an idea, and you tell the idea to the group, all the people in the group is going to give an opinion, and they will tell you if your idea is good, or it is bad. In that way you can have more ideas for you and your group, and your group, and you can learn more from your ideas. Working in a group can be more helpful, because you and all the people in the group can have more ideas and finish faster. Even thought some people prefer to work alone, because they think that they can be more concentrate, and they can learn faster. In conclusion in a group you can finish faster and have more ideas for you and your group. While working alone you can concentrate more because you have less talking, and you are less distracting, when you work alone you can learn more, because you find the answer at your own.
