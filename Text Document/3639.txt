Some schools have a program that older students pair with younger students and let's talk about how the effects can be very beneficial in the students future. One reason this would be most beneficial is that the younger students are getting there education from someone who already knows about the basic of reading, pronouncing words the younger students just have not reached potential and these older students are pushing these younger kids the right way. Another reason Having older students pair up with younger students is a very beneficial idea is that it teaches a student what skills are necessary to be a teacher just encase they want to be a teacher one day. Third reason a younger student pairing up with an older student is beneficial is because it makes the older student feel more responsible for somebody else is learning like making sure the younger student knows this like making sure he/she knows how to pronounce words correctly make sure the younger student can be organized. A fourth reason that proves younger kids pairing up with older kids is beneficial is that the teacher has a couple less students to deal with so less stress to deal with younger kids can be annoying to deal with sometimes.
