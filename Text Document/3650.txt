Thomas Jefferson wrote, "Determine never to idle... It is wonderful how much may be done. If we are always." Do what we accomplish more if we are always doing something, or does inactivity also serve a purpose. I try to do my best to Accomplish everything, I can as fast I can to catch up. Not being active it's not good nor healthy, and It wouldn't help you progress in future reference. It helps you to be more prepare and organize and. Ready for everything. Always have a mindset goal, realistic goals, and measurable. We do Accomplish more if we're doing something, keeping yourself occupied. Sometimes when you're not doing anything, (meaning) being inactive, It's to rest for an amount of time. To think and, analyze our point of views and, ideas." Determine to never be Idle" (meaning lazy) I know there's time when we all want to be lazy and not doing anything, but that's not get you nowhere near your Goals. As Thomas Jefferson said" It's Wonderful how much can be done if we are always doing". Thomas Jefferson has an amazing point with this Route. This route Has a lot of manful information behind it, and I think everyone a own way to learns about it. Not any person create a good route mostly, Route are written or said by people Who were Famous, or made a great impact in our world, and, they're always going to be remembered as the person and their story. This is all I have to say about my prompt.
