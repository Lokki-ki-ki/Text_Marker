The work in group is more better than work alone, in the beneficial is the student work in group is have more opportunity of learn more with other students in the class, they can work better and understand more quickly the theme in the class and have more collaboration, learn to respect other students. They in the group can say new ideas for the team. I think in the personal the work in group is more productivity in the student because have a good communication with the students and teacher, they have more positive attitude in the ideas and participation. For example, students in the group work more and learn more quickly because in group have a higher quality of ideas, and students can change ideas together about the theme in the class and have a better determination in the job of the class. Second, work in group have a big benefit in the class because students understand problems more quickly, and they have solution in theme complicated with ideas and dedication in class. Third, students have collaboration with other students have a good relation and learn to respect others person for religion or ideas. They have more communication in the class and have better grade in the school. However, work alone not have good result because almost all the student have fear to say ideas for the critic of other students in the class, and they have slow work in the class for complication of the theme. The preference is work with a group have more benefit in the student and teacher to learn and teach other students in the school have more communication, better work and good relation in the school.sincerelyGeneric_Name
