Yes, I do agree with Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill's statement, because people do fail over and over again without loosing enthusiasm. I have good enthusiasm. For example, I failed a lot of classes in high school and I had to repeat them I gave all of my best effort on every class I had to take even if I wasn't good at it or if I didn't like it because I don't want to keep repeating them just because I didn't try I have great confidence on every skill I have and I always try to improve them in a better way I ask for help to see what I need improve on, and I eventually did get better, and it was worth it because it made things much easier I understood all the problems I had trouble with I brought my grades up on the class I was failing on I mostly got B's on the tests and quizzes its way better than getting a D I was glad that I was making changes and improvement on my skills it was the best thing I have ever done. I have don't ever give up, for example one time I remember I had to do make a little video game for my school project and as I was making it I didn't know what kind of video game to make I didn't have any ideas of what to make and I thought of giving up because I didn't know what to make and then I started thinking of making a first person shooting game, and it was mostly like the game Call of Duty but I made a little change to it, I put in the choices to choose any gun from the previous games it can be a gun from any Call of Duty game I feel like that was a good idea because some people would really like to have some old weapons back, and they like a game that is boots on the ground and I also made a zombie game mode I put in some better things in that mode and I kept adding more details to the game and I am actually glad that I didn't give up because it tells me that I am not a quitter and that i won't be giving up so easily. Some people would disagree with Winston Churchill statement because they don't believe that failure would consist of success they think that if you fail you're going to fail again over and over no matter how hard you try your always going to fail I know some people say that because I had a friend that literally gave up so fast it was pretty sad and I kept telling him that you have to keep trying there's no other choice you can do but push yourself, and he didn't he just gave up and didn't even bother to try. However not everyone gives up so fast because they believe in themselves they don't lose their confidence even when they are not at their best they still won't give up because they know they can do better the next time they do it you just got to keep trying till you make it.
