Winston Churchill once said "success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm", Meaning success can only be achieved by having few mistakes along the way. Many believe achieving success means doing everything perfect and not making one single mistake, having a couple of mistakes doesn't mean failure it means progress to be successful because one can learn from the mistakes that are made and helps improve to achieve something better. To be successful, there will be some mistakes in the journey but when those mistakes are made learning from them is the best way to accomplish your goal. For example, when one is constructing a house but have little knowledge on construction, the one building the house will mess up and fail at times but the best way to finish something is to learn from what went wrong. To clarify, to accomplish a certain goal, learning from the mistakes along the journey is the best way to do it. Not only learning from mistakes help be successful, but it also helps improve one another. Improvement is a big key in success. Failure will always have a role in success, but it happens to help improve to become or do something better. For example, famous alleles in sports make mistakes in games all the time, but from the failures in the past, pro alleles train to improve more to become better and to not make the same mistakes again. In other words, failure may be the worse, but it's a way to show what to improve. From mistakes made in the past one will become better or do better than expected. Having a couple of mistakes doesn't mean failure it means progress to be successful. Failure will play an important role during the journey of success, but you learn from mistakes and improve to be better, success isn't perfect, the little mistakes along the way are actually the things that make one get to the top and become successful.
