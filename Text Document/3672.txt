It is important to share a lesson with elementary school students because, as they get older they can know what they have learned when they were younger. Elementary school students learn way more when someone is teaching them a lesson instead of the kids learning it by there self. Teaching kids a lesson in school or out of school is not a bad thing to do because kids and others can learn anything out of school walls, once they start go grow up they will understand what they have learn and what not have learned in elementary school, and of the hard effort the kids have put into there work in school and at home. Why is giving a lesson to elementary schools important ? I feel like it is important because you're teaching them something they have not learned or know about what they will be learning about yet, teaching younger kids can be really nice and all, but some of these kids can be very hard to take care of and handle like upper up classes/grades. When giving a lesson to a class can be difficult and all that, but it can also be fun to teach them some cool things they should know about and teach them easy work, so they can understand the work faster, and so they can see what level or understatement they are at, kids that go to elementary school can be way easier and faster to teach because upper grade level can get hard and exhausted, cause of their beavers and they way they love to act in front of other people which, they shouldn't be acting like that. Younger students know better than not to behave awful and act crazy, that's why I think it is important to teach younger kids then older kids, younger students they well, they know what they are doing, also understand of the work we teach them, but we always got to teach them very well and help them with the lesson we have given and show how it is done and how to do it without being upset.
