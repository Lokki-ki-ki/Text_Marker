People who value self-reliance define dependence. Following your own instincts and making your own decisions is the whole point of life in my opinion. It makes a person more independent and trustworthy. Also, helps a person learn from own mistakes. A person will always have guidance. Whether its from parents, teachers, police officers, or even a person you don't even know can give you some type of guidance. It always goes back on how the individual is going to view it. Independence is very important. Having full control and capability of standing alone can make a person realize what is best for them. Also, not being easily influenced can help a lot. Understanding what is best for you can make your decisions much easier. People need to learn from their own mistakes. Mistakes happen every day. A persons instincts may not always be right, but it will benefit them in the future. Another person is not going to tell you something you want to hear or give you the assurance you need for something. They may think they know what's best for you but personally for you, it could not be the best. Knowing yourself and knowing how you like things to be done is another example of self-reliance. Seeking guidance from experts and authorities can be the right thing to do. It can save a person from debating too much on a decision. Help a person plan better for the future and not really let the person struggle. As well, as to prevent the individual to stress out of what not knowing to do. However, a person own instincts and ideas is what makes the person value self-reliance. And know what's best for them. Who knows you better than you? To conclude, it's all about self perspective. On how you view things for yourself and your future. Being independent and not rely on others opinions. Having your own thoughts and opinions. Accepting that making mistakes is okay not everything has to be right and perfect.
