The first impression doesn't mean that you are like your look, or because your look angry you are a bad person. One day in the morning my dad show me a picture of my grandfather, he was a tall and stronger men, more later my dad come to my room, and he tells me "We are going to know you grandfather", I was scared but, when I see hem, he was adorable and so loving with me, when a know my grandfather more, I change my opinion of the first impression, he was not a rude man. When I see for the first time a girl that I never seem, the first that I see is how the girl look if she looks angry, I think is that she is disagreeable, but in the future, when I know more about that girl I know that she is not how I was thinking in the first impressions, is not good to judge people for how they act, it doesn't care the color of the eye, the color of the skin or what language they speak. Some people look bad, sad, happy, angry, or evil but that's not mean that they are like they look. In conclusion the first impression it's possible to change, because the people can not act how you think they act, or they can change the attitude in the future, when I know more about this person my opinion of the first impression change.
