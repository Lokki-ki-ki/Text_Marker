I would have to disagree to these statements. Letting is controlled by the world(people)it's not a good idea. There are so many things to accomplish, by not being controlled by other people. We can so many things without people controlling us, we can succeed our life. We can actually be someone though our hard work and deduction. Being us:just being who you are would be the best and great choice to do. You would think properly with correct knowledge, just by doing that, You would accomplish so many things in life without people going agents you. NOT being you or being someone you really not are, is not a good idea. Don't let them control you:letting people control who you are, isn't a good thing. Many people think is a good thing because they can face or attention, It's like having a double life, 1: living the regular life, being who you really are, 2: Being out in public pretending to be someone when your not. You won't accomplish the things you want to do when your not yourself. You will feel important when the world wants you be someone. Be yourself and accomplish the things you want to do, and you will improve your skills and achievements. They will just control your life, and they won't help you on the long run. No one can control someone's life who they want them to be. Being us, not them:We need let people do what they want we shouldn't be controlling their life. Everyone should choose there who they want to be and what to do. Not everyone should be controlling them. Not everyone is they same, they are different from others. They don't know their weaknesses to be telling them to be. We shouldn't be controlling other people what to become. Many people do it for the fame and attention, but they are the most unsuccessful people. They don't achieve things they go by there fame and people. We should be us and not be someone we can't be. They end up being embarrassed.
