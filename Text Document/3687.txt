I agree with Emerson's statement about individuality "To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment" because of Success, being yourself, and being the owner of you life. First success is the most important thing for the society because we all need great people like philanthropist who help to reduce poverty in the world, great inventor who great thing that today we cannot live with out it such as Car, internet,and computer. And the Evolution of Human being by creating a safe environment for everyone to live a long and healthy life. Secondly being yourself is a great accomplishment because you truly the person you want to be, you are true to the people around you being showing them who you really are by acting truly without faking who you are, and you are live a meaningful live by being yourself instead of what the world want you to be. Thirdly being the owner of you life is really important because you can your own decide, you can decide what kind of future you want, and being able to make this decision by yourself will make you life grateful, and mostly a healthy live. Some people will say that is worthless or is better to be told what to do, but being able to great your Success, being yourself, and being the owner of you life is something really important for the development of Human life and for every individual to decide what they want to be or what they have plan for they future. All this will drive a person to a great accomplishment because life is a text and every individual have a different text so being yourself in this world will always be a great accomplishment because some people a conditioner to live the live that the world gave them.
