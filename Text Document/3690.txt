For a student like me, working in a group is a lot better than working by my by self. Here are some reasons why working in a group is better than working alone. Number one we finish the assignment a lot faster. Number two everyone is working on something different. Number three everyone is helping each other if we're struggling on something. There is the bad part about working in a group is that there is a lot of distraction, there is also different ideas that everyone wants to put in the assignment. Now lets look at the good part on working on the assignment alone. Number one there are no distractions getting in between you working. Number two there is only your idea on how you want it to look like. Number three you can ask the teacher on how shear he wants the assignment to be done, so that means that the assignment is going to be correctly done. The bad part on working alone is that there is going to take more time on the assignment to be done. The other part is that you have to do all the work by your self and have to rely on your self. Other words if you pick to work in a group or by your self, are going to be struggling kinda the same thing as how mush work you have to finish, the different ideas on how you what it to be looking like or how you want it to be done. Ones again for a student like me, I rather work in a group than by myself because knowing my self i won't finish my work or the assignment. In a group I can have one part on the assignment that I have to finish. You can say I am picking on working in a group to do less work, and you are right because It's going to be done instead of not doing the whole assignment. So for my conclusion I would want to work in a group instead of working alone because "team work makes the team work."
