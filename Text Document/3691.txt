I Think that no matter if you are taking online classes, or going to school, you're always going to graduate you can learn a lot if you're taking online classes. Like if I were on the position of taking online classes, because I'm working and I don't have that much time I would love to study when ever I could. For Example:some people that are here in the United States they have to go to school and work after school, and they got to pay rent, send money to their families back in there Countries. For Example:Some people don't have someone that can take them to school and the school is far away that the buses can not go all the way to their homes. For Example:There are some kids that don't go to school, having the school next to them, but there's a lot of people out here the would love to go to school or even take online classes, but they can't because some of them are always working, some of them even have two jobs. For Example: My mom would loved to take online classes at less, but she can't because she has to work in the very morning like at 7 am, and she comes back like at one she cleans the house and then like at 3pm she goes to her other job, and she gets out like at 11:30 pm, so she doesn't have time, but she would love if she could do it. For Example: My dad he's going all the way to DC for school because he is taking classes for duster he pays each moth and my dad works to in construction but weekends she goes to DC the classes start like at 10, and they end like at 1,if you like something work hard for what you like. For Example: I have a friend that he takes online he works every day, he takes his computer to his work so when he's on break runs to the computer, and he starts school online like that someone that wants to progress in this country.
