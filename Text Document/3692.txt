Do you remember when you decided what you wanted to be? ''your character will be what yourself choose to make it''. Do we choose our own character traits, or is our character formed by in fluences beyond our control? I agree Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it. Because, you make your own decisions, you take responsibility, and you have goals. However, many, believe that people influence the way we choose our characters because they think they have the right to critics the way people decides. Actually, this is a bad idea because people makes their own decisions, In society most of the time we have to take a decision whether are right or wrong we must take it at some point but is also, your choice to make the best out of it. For example, My brother had to take a decision by himself which was doing something in life going to collage study or work as a McDonald co-worker he decided the best was going to collage and keep studying. If, my brother wouldn't have taken that decision then he had lost an opportunity to make it. The second reason your character will be what your self choose to make it, is that you take responsibility because taking responsibilities make a better character of your self. For example, when you wake up early just to be on time at work every day you feel you are giving the best of you yourself are choosing to make your character. If, you are not giving the best of you every day that means you are not choosing to make your own character. The third reason your character will be what your self choose to make it, is that you have goals because you want to feel satisfied when you have achieved something important in your life. For example, when getting your first bachelor degree when getting your dream job or you worked so hard for your dream car you always wanted. If, you don't have goals to follow then you are not going to make it. In conclusion, make your own path, you are encharge, and you have dreams to follow.
