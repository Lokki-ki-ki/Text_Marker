I disagree with this statement because anyone can change their first impressions if you just give then time and a second chance instead of just seeing them mess up. The first reason that you can change your first impression is just by giving them another chance that they can change because everyone deserves a second change when people mess up their first impressions you should be able to let them change it because even you might of mess up on your first impressions on a cuisines meeting or even on a date, and you do want them to remember your first impression they want to remember the time you changed your first impression to a better one to show people what you are really like. The second reason is that it can be about a really important meeting, and you messed up on your first impressions and the other cuisines people would be like "wow he messed up awful on his first impressions" and you want them to give you another chance, so you can fix your first impressions so they can be like "wow he really changes from the first time he was here". So give people to change their first impressions. The last reason is that your at your girlfriends house, and you are eaten with her and her parents, and you mess up, and the dad says"his not the type of guy you should be dating" just because you mess up now the dad does not like you anymore cause you mess up and we go again you must change that first impressions that you showed them the first time and make it better, so the dad doesn't hate anymore. So inclusion you should give everyone a second chance to change their first impressions and make it better, so they can see the person you really are.
