I agree with the Emerson's statement because when you have a mastered you work better on the something to do, with the mastered you get better opportunities, you get better position than the people no have the mastered.Nevertheless, not everybody agrees this opinion, some people disagree because sometime people with not have mastered make better the job than the people with mastered. First, when you have a mastered your work better on this sometime to do, because this people has years to study and practice. For example in restaurant when you have a mastered on chef you only need to memorize the recipes, other people need to memorize the condiment's, the tools, and the machines is used. Second, with the mastered you get better opportunities, because you have a title show you already prepared for the job. For example some companies need you have a mastered for the job or the position, is like a some restaurants if you want to work like manager you need a mastered, and you get more money. Third. You get better position than the people no have the mastered, because you show your experience. For example if on restaurant need people for kitchen, manager and dishwasher with mastered you get the position of manager and the people with not have mastered is more probably put in dishwasher and if he wants to work with manager need more time and work more hard. In conclusion people with mastered have better opportunities, work better on the something to do and get better opportunities than the people with no have mastered. For this reason I agree the Emerson's statement about if you don't have a mastered you never grow.
