If we didn't take an action, What should we do? Thomas Jefferson wrote, "Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing something. Accomplish more can give your dreams and goals in your life. We Accomplish more if we are always doing something because Many people supported us, Take a risk and do action and Be yourself. People might say Inactivity also serve a purpose because god has a plan for us. Others might say inactivity also serve a purpose because dream takes time. Still others might say inactivity also serve a purpose because they say you need to think first before do the action. There's some reason to help you to accomplish more.1. Many People supported us. Why? They want you to be successful because they want you to live a better life and to not experience the poverty in life. They know that you have a dream because they love you, and they know you as a person.2. Take a risk and do action. Why? You want to achieve something in your life because achieve something is to know yourself more, and you want to prove in yourself that you can achieve something and you need an experience so you can handle all that risk that you take it before and to do your best next time.3. Be Yourself. Why? Because you have a dream in your life. You see yourself that you achieved your dreams someday, and we know that people have a dream that want to achieve someday. You know to yourself that you can do all because you encourage yourself and your family that "you can do this" and you already accomplished a lot. We Accomplish more if you know to yourself that you can do something because people in your side supported you, You encourage yourself that you can do all and even there is a lot of risk, still fight for your dreams. If we didn't take an action, so you can't accomplish or achieve something in your life.
