Imagine having a secret talent. Talking or singing with my mouth close is a talent, because it makes people happy, and it also helps me feel less nervous. It makes people feel happy because, one day kids were playing outside I decided to tell them funny jokes with my mouth close. The kids felt happy and were wondering how to talk without moving your mouth. Sometimes I tell my friends that I like their smile with my mouth close. It makes them smile more because they know it's me. Having a talent can make people happy, and you can also make their day. It also helps me feel less nervous and helps me talk to people a lot with my mouth close. One example is that when I sing I get really nervous so just sing with my mouth close and nobody looks at me because I am not moving my mouth. Singing with my mouth close makes me feel confident. When I am walking and people are asking for directions I get to do it with my mouth close. Talking with my mouth close helps me a lot when I don't want to talk or when I am having a bad awful day. Sometimes is hard to communicate, and it is hard not to be nervous so talking and singing with my mouth helps me a lot. Eveyone has a talent. Singing with your mouth close or talking is a talent because it makes you feel happy, and sometimes it helps when you are nervous. You can make people happy when you have a talent. It also helps you to be more confident with yourself. You also get to share with the world what you are able to do. I think that sometimes when you have a talent can help people and can make everyone else happy.
