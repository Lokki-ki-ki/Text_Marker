Do curfews keep teenagers out of trouble? In this essay I will discuss as to why curfews could be a necessary law for teenagers. One of the reasons curfews could help out parents keep their children safe is that teenagers like to hang out with friends late at night and having a curfew for teenagers could prevent them from getting in some sort of trouble. Another reason why curfews could keep teenagers more safe is teenagers think they know everything in this world but in reality they don't know how the world really is and anything can happen at any certain time. The finale reason why I think some teenagers need to have curfews is because some teenagers are still not mature enough to be out late at night and something could possibly happen to them. I think the 3 reasons listed above is more than enough evidence to have curfews for teenagers to keep them safe and to keep parents aware and calm for their children. As a parent or guardian of a teenager we all want to keep our children as safe as possible because anything could happen outside our homes. In concussion, I think the 3 reasons listed above is more than enough evidence to have curfews for teenagers to keep them safe and to keep parents aware and calm for their children. As a parent or guardian of a teenager we all want to keep our children as safe as possible because anything could happen outside our homes. Curfews can be good thing to keep parents aware of what their children are doing, but I personally think they should not be a law for every teenager. For example some parents they are OK with letting their child be out late at night but as long as they stay in contact with a parent at all times. That shows that not every teenager in this world is irresponsible and is aware for their own actions.
