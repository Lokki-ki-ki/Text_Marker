I take "Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing." Because the more you do, the more you get done. And that will make your life so much easier. You should never wait for tomorrow to do something if you can do it today. Also, you can't be idle for the rest of your life. You can't be successful if you're just going to idle. To be something in life you have to work hard for it. You always have to push yourself to the max limit. But at the end it'll all be worth it. I remember my mom always used to tell me that "Never wait for tomorrow to do something that you can do today." And that will be in my head for the rest of my life. I use that quote to motivate myself when I'm doing homework or going to the gym etc. It always works and I will always live to that. My whole family lives to that quote. The world would be such a better place if people didn't idle. If people were determined to work hard for themselves, everybody in the world would be successful. Also, more people would be enjoying a more wealthy life. Fewer people wouldn't need a place to sleep. There would be more people inventing stuff to make the world a better place. Everybody in the world would have water and food. You would make your whole family proud. Give back to the people. Do unreal things that no human has ever done before. Maybe even go to every planet to see if humans are able to live there. There would be fewer crimes and fewer lives lost. Also, more opportunities for people to succeed. Finally, Thomas Jefferson wrote that quote for a reason. For people to succeed in life. It was for people to look at the quote and actually do it and not idle. Thomas Jefferson wanted people to do great things. He wanted people to always be doing and not idle. If you're determined you will succeed. Never give up.
