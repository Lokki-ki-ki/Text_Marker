The creation of an after school homework club will be a horrible idea because of students not going to it, the homework will not be challenging, and making lazy students lazier. In my opinion, if the school created an after school homework club, nobody will come. Students can be lazy and do not want to do their homework. There are many other ways to help students improve in their behavior and achievement. Homework is just a way to reinforce the main study. If the Principal decides to establish this "Club," it will make the homework easier. Homework is to reinforce the main idea of studies, if they make it easier, then what will be the point of homework. A homework club will be a disaster; the students will be lazier than before! Not to mention that the school will not use any more homework for it has become useless to reinforce subjects. In conclusion, Establishing an after school homework club will be a disaster, with homework not being able to reinforce the students with subjects, making the students lazier, and the idea that no one will go there.
