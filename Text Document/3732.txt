Many schools allow their students to visit different types of companies, so they could explore many interested jobs, for example schools and companies get in a deal to help students to get knowledge for their future and also companies allow students to be able to visit and get information in their occupations, I know as a fact that students can be professionals in what they want with good knowledge, as an example my whole family went through all of that and know they have become lawyers, doctors,and one of them works for the president. If managers give students the opportunity to visit their occupations, students who work hard won't lose that excellent opportunity, and managers would have an amazing great roll in students achievement which I know it would help the company. Although some say that companies should not give me the opportunity to explore and visit their occupations because if the company that I went to visit doesn't have that much of opportunities for me to discover, whether I'm interested in what they have, and I may be disappointed, and probably I would have in mind to talk bad about the company that they don't have sufficient knowledge or information, actually companies should give me the opportunity to explore and visit their occupations because I would have a great experience of the excellent opportunities that they may have, and I as a student I will have the experience to explore and get some knowledge at a young age of the opportunities that I can be able to get if I prepare to have an amazing future. Some say that companies should not give me the opportunity to explore and visit their occupations because if the company that I went to visit doesn't have that much of opportunities for me to discover, whether I'm interested in what they have, and I may be disappointed, and probably I would have in mind to talk bad about the company that they don't have sufficient knowledge or information, for example, my older brother had the opportunity to visit an important company called "Dream Big"he expects that in that company they would have information about what he was interest, but sadly it didn't went that well, my brother was sad and angry at the same time, so he made a fake account to talk about the company, as a result the company decrease in a 20% of people that were involved. Companies should give me the opportunity to explore and visit their occupations because I would have a great experience of the excellent opportunities that they may have, for example, my mother always tells me a story about how she became a lawyer, she said that as a student, she was preparing herself for the future, thanks to school, they gave her a chance to explore and get some knowledge about lawyers in a company called "Everything is possible, if you believe it"she had the chance as a lawyer to meet the president, also there is a story about her on the internet, she became a lawyer because she had the opportunity. I as a student I will have the experience to explore and get some knowledge at a young age of the opportunities that I can be able to get if I prepare to have an amazing future for example, I read about an incredible woman who know is a professional chemistry teacher, in the story gave details about how she became who she is it doesn't specific which company she went to learn about her career, but the point is that she has an excellent job, because she got prepare for it. Although some say that companies should not give me the opportunity to explore and visit their occupations because if the company that I went to visit doesn't have that much of opportunities for me to discover, whether I'm interested in what they have, and I may be disappointed, and probably I would have in mind to talk bad about the company that they don't have sufficient knowledge or information, actually companies should give me the opportunity to explore and visit their occupations because I would have a great experience of the excellent opportunities that they may have, and I as a student I will have the experience to explore and get some knowledge at a young age of the opportunities that I can be able to get if I prepare to have an amazing future. As a result schools and companies help students in their goal to have knowledge with their interest, and for sure parents would be thankful.
