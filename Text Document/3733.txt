Therefore, I agree with being honest all the time because it will help you gain trust with others. This can also sit that the person think's you are loyal and trustworthy and that they can believe in you more than they already did. Yes is may hurt the person feelings, but, you are there to help them get though it and make them feel OK. When being honest with people it can build up trust with you two because they know that you can talk about things without lying. This can also afford how they see you as a person. Even if the truth hurts them they know that you were able to tell them what was happening or if someone was saying something bad about them. This can also build up trust and build up friendship and relationship. People don't like it when you lie to them because it hurts them and makes them feel bad about them self. Honesty can change how people view you as a person. They can even see if you would be loyal to them when they need you the most. They can also see if you're a real friend or something more with being honest. This can also give you respect that you want or need. When I said they would view you different I meant by your personalty and how you are as a person. Yes, honesty can hurt them, but, lying hurts the most. Why I'm saying this because honesty can hurt, but it makes them feel better because they have someone they trust and belief them, a real friend. Lying and changing up the word can hurt them and even mess them up and change them. That why I agree with being honest all the time.
