Dear principal, I think students should be required to this perform service, so student's could learn a lot about reading. Because it is very important for student's to learn how to read stories and understand more about language arts. Also, it's very important for students to join the community service to graduate to college and get a job. Also, I also recommend this to student, so they could grow up one day and be a teacher or a doctor this is a good require.
