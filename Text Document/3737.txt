The lesson for elementary students is what kind of the subject that all students are really into. There are many of subjects lesson like science English math history etched lesson would I like to share to students is sign lounge. This is new lesson for students to community with others while using their own hands. Not many people don't know what is sign lounge. It alright to teach sign lounge to students because one day they met someone who know only sign lounge so he/she can community to the person. There are some school that are teaching students sign lounge to community in the real world. Sign lounge is still use til this day around the globe. Why sign lounge was made for? There not many people can hear or talk so he/she use sign lounge to community to others to people around. Even though things are different in sign lounge and talking to community. You remember even words to community to person or people and in sign lounge you'll remember all hands sign to community to the person or people. It choose for your own if you want to learn something new in sign lounge. Sign lounge is not the only thing that people don't know. The people who can't see he/she use Morse is code to learn it almost like reading but it to learn in real world. Ever letters and numbers have code like sign lounge. They are both different but unquiet ways to learn.
