Dear Business Manager.First this essay is written with the meaning of what kind of occupations I would like to do as student, which is good to know that there is someone that is interested on helping students like me, also as student I would like to start by the right way and taking what is the best for me for example what is going to be a job which will make me feel comfortable to know that my qualities and my knowledge will play an important roll depending on the job that I might get. To tell you more about what I like to do is simple and easy at the same time, it doesn't matter how hard something it gets for me because in the end I always end up pulling through, although I like to think before make a choice because it is always hard when I do stuffs at the very beginning with no concern or knowledge of what do I suppose to do. In this case, as a beginner I get excited no matter what the work it might be, I can tell that I'm not afraid to begin with new challenges. So one of the reasons you should invite me for job opportunities is because unlike the rest of my partners at school they don't have the spirit of a fighter like I do, because I always try to give it all I've got because I know this is my heart and like my dad told me ones if "is you don't fight for it doesn't expect for the things that you want to come for you", and to prove myself that I can be someone on this world having a good job and be respected for it, so I can be able to support myself and my family as well, work hard in every little single thing I do is what I have to make sure that I can be capable and responsible for doing it. In the other hand let's say that at least for now I want to graduate from high school, then go to college to start a career of mechanic, because mechanic is the number one on my checklist in other words my favorite, however this is it be a big opportunity if you actually choose me for the job opportunity, because as it is for me this is going to be a perfect starting for me, after all I think I can show you what I mean by saying I don't give up because my father always told me when I was a little kid; no matter what happens after I had to give it all, never leave a bit of what I could let on my effort, also because he is being a great example for me since I was a kid or since I remember my childhood. Instead of being a bad boy, he showed me what do I have to with my values and things that really matter to me, so that is pretty much of what I can be capable of when it becomes to a responsibility. Persistent is other word that goes with my personality, if you want someone who really want to do something when it becomes to work, I think I might have the qualities that you are looking for any kind of job. So that's my response to what you might be looking for, I just hope that you can choose me, Thanks.
