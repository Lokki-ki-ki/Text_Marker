Dear Generic_Name, I would like to visit your hospital one day. I would like to be a midwives nurse but in order for me to purse that education. I will have to see what I have to do. People say I would need a master’s degree to become a midwives nurse. All I can say is that I am perfect with babies. I would like to tell you why I would like to be a midwives nurse. Ever sense I laid eyes on my baby cousin. I wondered if all babies will have that huge smile on their face like she did. Seeing all moms be happy to see their own children just makes my day. I just love seeing moms cry tears of joy because they finally saw the own child. This is why I am hoping that you give me a chance to explore how to be a midwives nurse. I just don't want to be behind schedule, and if I explore early I will be able to get a head start. I want to grow up and be useful not useless. There is not going to be a lot of people around to help, but I am hoping to see every baby be safe. In order for that to happen I need to be thought to be one of the best. I searched up on the internet that there is much advance stuff to become a midwife nurse. Like first there is a regular college student taking notes, then the master’s degree, then there is the midwife nurse. I am just hoping that I do well, and if I do something wrong please tell me.
