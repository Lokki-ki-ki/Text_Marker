I disagree about extending school because, Parents might want to spend time with their kids after school on a regular day after school and if school was extended parent might have already gone to work by the time you get home. Parents might have done an appointment with a doctor right after a regular day at school, but if the time extended at school the doctor might have already closed. Kids would want to get out of school to talk with their friends or have fun doing what they like best. The teachers might not get paid more than a normal day at school. Teachers should get paid more if school was extended. I would not like school to get extended because, I have more important things to do after school like taking care of my brother or take care of my dogs. My parents are never home and my older sister is. My parent tell me to help my sister clean the house after school but when I get home she never cleans until before my parents come, and if school was extended she would never clean the house and my parents would already be heading home. This is why I think school should not be extended. And the most important thing is that nobody wants to be in school.
