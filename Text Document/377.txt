Dear principal have taking my position and say that all student should help make this world a cleaner planet so that we can live on it. So i think that all student should do community server. Sorry I have not introduced my self. My name is PROPER_NAME I go to the school. an second graded. And i think that all students should make this place a better place to live in. I also thing that does student that don't want to cleaned up should be punished. Punish with lunch detention.i think making all the student do community serves will help theme stay out of trouble. Helping cleaned the community will let student out of trouble, to not use drugs or alcohol. They will know how important is to keep our environment cleaned. So that the pollution stops. And also to not make this place bad fora our babes. That one day we may have. So please principle don't let the planet come to and end. Let help our planet be a safe place to live on not a bad and ugly planet. And all of those kid that are cleaning the environment should have a party a Green Day party that shows how they care of our planet. And wanted to be a safe place to livening. From STUDENT_NAME
