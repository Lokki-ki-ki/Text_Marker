Although some people don't like using technology it's a good thing because thanks to technology we can now talk with family members who live far away, and also you can meet lots of new friends on the internet. But I get some people are afraid to talk to new people because they don't know about the person their meeting with but once they meet the person they talk about what the person life is like. But technology is taking over the world because for example stores are getting shut down because you can now buy anything on the internet there's no point of having stores everyone now uses Amazon or eBay to stuff that you would find in Walmart. And a lot of stores are already out of business like Kmart because stuff you would find at Kmart are on Amazon or eBay. Cars can be bought online you don't need to go to the dealership you now just get your computer and look for the want, and they can deliver the car right to your house.Also, we have Tesla which are cars that are electric, and you charge them instead of putting gas in them and also they this feature called Autopilot which means the cars drives by its self and all you have to do is pull that switch on and then just have your hands on the steering wheel for safety reasons, but they are trying to make it where you only have pulled the switch and just look out the window also they are very fast it can beat a Lamborghini and when you brake you are charging the battery. But also people are losing their jobs because of this, but they can also work using technology instead of working at a store they work at an Amazon factory plus they pay very well. So what do I think of technology I think it's awesome because it gives you new opportunity's that we use to not have when technology did not exist. And it's changing not only the world but also the universe because we have technology everywhere like in the moon we sent a Tesla Roadster, and we also have satellites in the sky that tell us what happening in the sky.
