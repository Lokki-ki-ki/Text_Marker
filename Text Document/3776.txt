Thomas Jefferson once wrote "determine never be idle, it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing.". I completely agree with this statement because if you do not want to do anything then how are you sure it will happen. If I want money and I do not have a job then how will I ever get money. If you want a job, and you only sit on your couch how will you get a job? The answer to that question is you won't because you are not going out and applying for a job. You have to be active, and you have to always keep looking until you have the job you want. Nobody will come to you and tell you"Do you want this job?". You have to get it and if you are not doing anything to get it nobody will. In today's society people do not want to be active in what they want to get, they want evening to be given to them. How can we give people something they did not work for they need to be active and search for what they want to get it. People may disagree with my statement and say "You do not need to be active for things to be done or to get a job.". If you are not active then how do you know things will come your way. Everything you get in life is earned through being active and getting things done nothing comes at a snap of your fingers.
