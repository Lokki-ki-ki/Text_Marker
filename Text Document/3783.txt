You never try to do something by yourself unless what you have already mastered, you will not grow all the time. You just will like a child and never grow up. Do you do something without any mastered? Even you are a young child, but you cannot always ask you parents and said" Mom (Dad), I don't know how to do this one, I don't know how to do that one." And let your parents do all something for you. You never try, and you will never grow. You are not a baby, you have to try to do something by yourself. When I was a child, do not understand what is "do you own thing by yourself ?'' My sister (older than me), she always told me '' help me to wash the dishes; help me to hang up the clothes...'' She will never do this a little thing. Have once time, my grandmother saw me and asked me '' what are you doing over here, is too dangerous. Come over here, quickly." '' Who let you hang up the clothes ?'' My grandmother said. I decrease my nice, and told her : '' is Generic_Name.'' Then my grandmom was anger, and told my sister :'' Why are you being so lazy, you can do all of this thing by yourself.'' Then, my sister, she was cried very lough. If you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you are not be a success person and grow in your life. You have a big, smart brain. In my memory, I am a lazy person. I do not know how to do that thing, but I do not want to think about how to do that, I will go to ask my parents or my sister. The people in the world, they should have a little mastered when they do something else. A little mastered for every thing, you will half of success. No people are very perfect in the world, only when you want to do better than last time.
