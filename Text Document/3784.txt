Do you think student would benefit from being able to attend classes from HOM? I support the student should be attended class from home because We do not have to go to School, and we can have more time with the family also We do not have to wake up early we can say safe at home.SD 1. Some students do not like to wake up early and they choose to take the classes online for the reason that student does not to ride the bus and can early to School.SD 2. In my opinion it is a good idea to take class online most in this time because so many bad thing are happened in the world for Example the coronavirus this is one of most reason that I support to attend class at home because We can do the classes online, and we can stay at home more safe and healthy.SD 3. Other good reason that is a good idea to take classes in home is that you mom know that you are in home because a lot of students scale and they mom thing that they are in the School so if people attend classes from home mom ready know the son in home.conclusion some students do not like to use the computer and they choose to come to School and other student they do not how to use computer but still doing a good idea the classes at home because you can have more time with your family also you don't have to wake up early to ride the bus, and you can do you work at home and take more break
