Some school district shifted to a four-day week and at ten hours for day, not because for financial needs, but others did so to make it parser to schedule sporting event or after-school activities. On my opinion, my school should follow the model by extending the school day two hours. Because they conserved energy and resources. The benefit of going to a four-day week and ten hours day for schooling, is that if offers teacher and students an additional day of rest every week. More rest than equates to dealing with less street over the courses of a school year. Students feel lees pressure, because they have more time to study at their own place at home, especially in the later grades. For example, I am senior in my school, if my school follow this model I will have more time for work in my homework. The disadvantages of four-day week and ten hours day. Shifting do this schedule does have certain disadvantages, especially for the working parent. For the parents of younger student, an additional full day of daycare nay need be scheduled very weed Instead of a partial day this leads to added costs that some families, living paycheck to paycheck, may not be able to afford. In conclusion, the school be should the four-day week and extending the school day two hours.
