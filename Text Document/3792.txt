Dear, PrincipalStudents may bring there phones to school, but they could only use them while there in lunch or any free time. Phones need to be turned off while in class or in the library if not they might get there phone taken away, and they need to pick it up at the end of the day. Student's phones must be in their backpacks or in their pockets during class. On, this policy by having phones at school the students should just leave their phones at home so it won't be taken by the teacher or so you won't loose it at school or other students won't have to rob you. So that's why students should really leave there phones at home. Another thing why students should not bring their phones to school at all it might fall and brake when you walk or if you're texting you might bump into each other believe that students really need to leave there phones at home because someone might call in the middle of class. Or a friend might text you in the middle of class also, so students leave your cell phones at home.
