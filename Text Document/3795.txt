Graduating early isn't a good idea because a lot of people find it difficult in maturing. Some people are lack of plan/organization in their life. It will be difficult for them to face the challenge the world have. I do not support it because I feel like the school are rushing to grow up to fast. They will leave you with a huge responsibility that you aren't ready to take on. Is like tell a new baby bird to fly in the world that fill with danger things. Most people that graduate early goes through depression because they are loosing a huge part of their childhood. From my point of view people who graduate find a huge difficult in life because when they graduate, they will have that mind set it is good idea to take a year of college because they graduated early and when you rest for a year you start to forget everything you learn and when you go to t college you have less memory on what u learn in high school. For a student to graduate early they most have a lots of requirements to graduate such a good record responsible and have a plan in life. Graduating early is a wasted of time and effort. All you got to do is bared the four and be will be prepared for the future instead of u jumping into the future without knowledge
