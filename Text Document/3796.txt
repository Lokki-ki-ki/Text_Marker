When I was working at the Daycare, it was not only me working and taking care of the kids, there were three more ladies doing the same job and working all together. So I think that is more benefit working in group that working alone because it makes easily the things. First, the first thing we do is give the kids breakfast, and while the kids are eating two of the ladies are looking after them, and the others two, are planning the activity that the kids are going to be doing during the day and try to keep them busy. Also, all ladies give ideas and at the end we try to put all ideas together and work on it as a team. While the day is passing, we do everything we need to teach and do the activities, and working all together is easily for us to finish early. When we finish early we always read or dance until the time to go home comes. Also, we disgust who was the one that behave was good, and we also give stars for the behavior to kids. Sometimes the kid don't behave well and if there were only one people taking care of the kids it most be difficult to do what we all four need to do. Also, everyone goal is to keep the kids safe, having fun, and also learning who to write, so at the time for them go to school they are going to feel relative and don't be scared of going to a regular school. And when that happen is how we know that we make a work together. As you see, I feel that is more beneficial working together in a group because, everyone in the group has ideas, is easily to Finnish everything fast and also everyone has the same goal.
