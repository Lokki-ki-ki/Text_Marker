Thomas Jefferson used wrote,'' Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing.'' It is a moral, people always doing things to achieve their life goals. As a person, we all have something want, it can be easy or impossible to get base on how much you have. In this realistic world, since we are born, we only can choose one lifestyle which is always doing something. This world needs useful person, mutually people always doing things for a more comfortable life. Different people have different life, one thing in common is they all have something must do. For example, students are working hard on learning new knowledge for a good grade on the tests, employers are working hard for a higher income to feed their families...even the boss is working hard to expand his/her companies. Most people are busy the whole life. I believe if you really want to do something, no matter how hard it is, and you are always doing it, you can accomplish your goal and have a ''surprising gift''. Life is fair, whether you are poor or unhealthy, It always takes care of hardworking one. On the other hand, what can we do if we determine to be idle? That will be extremely boring. I cannot image if I just sit on the bench a whole day and doing nothing, it is like a waste of time, a waste of life. However, inactivity also serve some purposes;Such as rest. But that's all I can think about. In my point of view, people are like the ants, they work together to make their home better. Basically, people always doing things whether they want or not. This is how the world functioned.
