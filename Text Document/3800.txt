I believe working as a group is more beneficial, because if you have the right crew you get to get so much done invest in stuff and finish it, and you get to earn more money as a group team. Working alone now I'm not to sure, when you work alone it can be quite challenging because you have a lot stuff to do and you are not sure if you might finish it unless if it's a small task. If it was a big task then it might take you the whole day or two days.I have experience as working in a group we had to finish 6 pallets unless making it 2 left, we finished the pallets so quickly that we thought where going to leave early, but we got some together finished. Now working alone man. That was challenging I tried finishing at least one but i couldn't because there was so much stuff in one pallet and I got to say I was new in that department, then that's when they sent me help. Working as a group is much more helpful than working alone there's a lot of different benefits as working alone and as a group but in picking which is better I will say working as a group unless if it's a small task, and you know you can get it done.
