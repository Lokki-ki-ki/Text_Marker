I think that students should commit to their career at a young age because it will move them and encourage them to go further into being someone that people can rely on, and it's a big help to society and the community, and it will help it a lot because theirs generations that had some kid that turn into an adult did their part in that generation and the after that and after that, and some things change in the peoples mind once they get older and wiser and that is the big picture. Also, some students might change that career because they want the best for themselves and it's not bad to change who you want to be in the future because no one is choosing this for them, they are the one that's doing this for the best of them so when they want to make money love what they do to get money with passion they are living the life of a normal money making person, and it doesn't matter how much money you're making It's STILL MONEY!!!! And some people around the world still don't get that. Soon they will want to go to college and that's big step into having their career because there's more studying to it and the teachers aren't as nice as you think they are, and they will be very comfortable with you goofing off in class, after that your out of the game, also it a lot of money to pay yearly for their tuition and depending on if your were born poor, rich, somewhat rich or wealthy enough to pay then your fine to stay in their to study party relax and play video games with the boys and eat a lot too if your close to a restaurant, caf√©, buffet or a diner then go ahead and fill up that empty stomach. After that when they have a good time their and read to graduate they'll go to a University, and I have to tell ya it not the same as college, it more studying and more work and if you can handle that pressure with no sweat then your set for a nice year in there, but depending on how long your going to stay there, it can 1,2,3 or 4 years when you think you have enough knowledge about your career and studies then your set to get a job that pays you well and have a happy life. Now that we got that out of the way, we need to talk about how the students are going to be effected by all that has happened to them and how far got to that end point of their journey to be successful in life and be some people he or she can help one another, so they make that persons' life better and make them feel happy, the students need to be happy with how they are working because if they don't, they can have stress and anxiety, and soon they don't want to work any more, and we can't have that in our generation, so we have to let them be someone that they want to be before someone else will!. Before all that, about all I said about the colleges and universities, their Parents, oh yeah the big dogs the ones who have created you to be a good person with a good career their child/student get older, the students have to tell their parents what they want to be when they grow up to be an adult, yes I know that they always say that when you were a little kid, but your still a kid but a teenager from the age 13-17, your still going to be told that, and you have pursued your dream or goal of being someone that goes without saying, so this is why students should identity their careers by the time they enter high school.
