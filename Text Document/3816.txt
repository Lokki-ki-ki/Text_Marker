The world is full of new things that can help make you an outstanding person. Trying something new will help you grow physically and mentally. Even if you don't believe you can do it, you can always try and see. I will prove that trying new things above your skill can make any person grow. Attempting something above what you already mastered can make you the best at whatever you love to do. If I was playing soccer for example, there are many positions to try. If I am already a great striker, why not try playing a defender position that I have never thought to do. This will make me a valuable asset to my team and I will grow with new skills. You can even grow academically by trying new things. It can't hurt to try something hard once in a while. When I am learning math, it doesn't make sense to try and understand a concept that won't make a difference to me, but it prepares me for harder problems in the future. If I do a difficult problem that I can't grasp, it is said that it only helps my problem-solving skills. There is no reason why it's not possible to master difficult problems.Others would say that some people have limits to their abilities. They argue that a person who is stuck can not grow. They are wrong because it's not so much a person can't grow but don't have the support or energy to want to be able to achieve higher. Sometimes they have issues with their self-esteem. I believe that every person can grow to a certain extent. In conclusion, I agree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson on his statement. A person that does not try new things above their own abilities will never grow. Based on my experiences, I understood that trying something I never mastered will only make me grow as a person.
