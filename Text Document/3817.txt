Studies have shown that one way to improve student achievement, is to start an after school homework club. Student stays for homework help, finish their homework early, and turn in their homework on time. So, we all have our homework to turn in on the next day. They're a lot of students that do their homework, don't do it, or some students might say, "I forgot my homework." Should people bring their homework to school? Of course, or what, you're just going to leave it at your house and forget to bring it to school. Always do your homework and do your homework at home or after school. On the next day, just prepare to turn in your homework and if you forget to bring your homework, ask your teacher and give a good reason why you left your homework. Then you can turn in your homework on the next day. People need help on their work. That's why they needed an after school homework club. They can go to their teacher to help what they need. If they go to after school and get a good helper, then they can be better and will know what they learn at after school. We can improve all the students to get a good knowledge and success, to be a good student. So students needs to turn in their homework and get a good grade. So, if you want that grade, you have to achievement and pass the class and get good grades. Turning your homework is one of the important grades to success and go your grade up.
