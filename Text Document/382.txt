I agree because nothing in this world is easy once you know you have it and the realizing that it will never grow. For example doing something that I might regret doing or not thinking positively before doing something also scared of not being to reach my goal in life. Second reason of why I do agree is because when you have that feeling that you feel good and confident about yourself you just know your doing great but then something inside you just wants to give up and throw everything away. Third reason I feel like if I stay int the same bubble I will never grow out of it by being scared and not having positive feeling's toward's me. I just think it isn't easy as it looks to lose something and seeing the won't grow from it. Lots of people make mistake's that they regret and they want to change that, but they can't, it's too late, but it's never too late to try all over again until you grow out of that spot. People just think giving up on things you like doing is easy to forget, but it's not because that's something you love doing, and you've mastered doing in all your life you've kept that positive view in your mind people just give up when they realize that they can't continue that's how you will never grow by giving up it's hard to when you come to a point that you committed a bad thing, and you regret doing you can't take it back, but life is also giving us the chance to improve and forget about everything and continue to grow bigger from that small place you feel inside you never give up on anything just continue on what you feel confident on doing and be happy. It's like falling in love with someone you follow your dream right you just don't throw it out grow of it and u will see.
