An old proverb says honesty is the best policy, but what happen if the policy with being honest at all time. The policy can help people to making decisions in my live. The policymaking by government and citizen need to following that but not mean you need to follow all. Last year, I have a best friend she has a nice character like honesty, helpful, good with everyone.... I talk with her about my parent, my sister, what I like or what I hate, I tell her everything's about me and I think she can keep those clandestine because we are friend. But not, she is so honest, somebody asks about those clandestine to tease me, and she answer all, about mine, my clandestine for they and I will be laughingstock with everyone." Honesty is the best policy", honesty is a nice character, but you don't need to being honest at every place and every time. A fantasy men invite me to buy something's for him, and I believe him because I am so honest and I think everyone will be good and honesty as me. Finally, I know him trick me but now I cannot do anything because him drop off. ....Sometimes you need to withstand, forceful, don't believe anything or anyone because you don't know what they want and give out your decision by your self. I think honesty it is nice quality, and it needs to be on each person but not that mean we being honest at all time.
