Highly agree with this statement, first impression are a big thing to most people because it shows them how you act around different people. My experience with first impression are quite because I get nervous around new people, However people aren't always going to base you of there first impression of you, Even though you can't change people minds on first impressions you can still change on how they look at you later on in life, just on your behavior around them and how you carry yourself around them. First impression are big key to finding new jobs because it shows the manager how you'll act on the job, and it will tell him/her if your worthy enough for the job, sometimes first impression are the reason you might even get the job like my brother experienced with his job he went to the interview with a positive altitude and went in with the mentality of getting the job, I really strongly agree with first impressions because people really will base you on first impressions. People first impression on me are weird and funny, I'm not even that weird most of the time i don't really care about first impressions because i don't base people of first expressions, I really base them on how they act after you look at them closer.
