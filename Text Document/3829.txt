Have you failed at some so much at one point you get so good at whatever you were failing at???well if you have this promo is for you. Yes i bevel that failure plays an important role in the pursuit of success, there was this one time when this kid wasn't so good a catching a football it kept slipping out his hands and after a while he was able to grip the football at the right time, if you don't practices stuff you bad at you're never going to get good at it, with that said that means your going to fail a lot over and over again. Failure is also life your going to fail in life but its you chose to get back up and try again until perfection, if you never fail you with never success so if you fail don't let it get you down keep trying and soon enough you be, althoght you might also think that that's not true because some people are really talented but keep in mind that none is good at something first NEVER try, I want you to try some you're not good at and keep practicing for about a month and see your progress, I would like for everyone to try this and see that fail does run a big roll in success.
