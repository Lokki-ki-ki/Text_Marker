Kahoot is one of the best educational activities for teachers to use in school and for kids to learn with. Because when ever kids are using Kahoot they work together to get the right answers, kids enjoy using Kahoot to learn better than using paper and books because kids get really bored with using paper and books, Paper and books are also boring for teachers to grade too. But, Kahoot keeps the kids more active when they are learning and gives the teacher better control of the kids. Also, kahoot is easy to teach with because when kids use paper and books the teacher has to go to the kids one by one just to correct their mistakes but when the teachers are using Kahoot they can explain the right answer faster and better in front of the whole class. Teachers who use papers and books are always tried because they have to grade them, one by one and can't go home until their done and teachers sometimes get really lazy. But, when teachers are using Kahoot to teach it easy to see who did it and who did not do it, and they do not get so tried and when the teachers are not tried they can teach better. And when kids use Kahoot they talk to each other and when kids talk to each other and work together they do a great job and nobody is left out or bullied. Parents will be able to help their kids learn more at home too and the more they use it the smarter they get. So that why Kahoot should be used in school and home. And if teachers and parents use Kahoot more school will go by faster and kids will be smarter.
