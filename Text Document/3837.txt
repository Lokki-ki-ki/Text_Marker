Dear, manager would like to choose and work at this place where you make controllers and stuff. Because you can learn how to design things, like perhaps learn how to make an interior design certain objects. And that's the platform i want to be in. Because when in that work space I feel more comfortable and why I chose it cause its just fun to make new designs to a controller, and you get quite the money for it of work because of that. What specific job is this it's to design Xbox controllers and stuff to make the controllers more meaning full, so people can buy them, such as when they want to have a good gaming experience. When they buy the controllers that are decently priced they will take care of it and when they do that they make the controller more money and this is why I chose this work place and specific job.
