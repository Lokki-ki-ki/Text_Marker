In the future I want to be a better person. Some people don't appreciate who I am or don't like the way I am. Like for example my friends are loud and I'm not and I like keeping things everything to my self and I don't really care what others say about me for me, it doesn't really hurt what they say they might think that it does, but it doesn't. People don't care about others feelings, I do in some way everyone matters. People you never talk to look at you in a weird or mean way, Others don't even get along. But they don't know who you really are without getting to know you like they say don't judge a book by its cover and I agree. My mom things that I go to school to look nice and its not true part of it is but I also try hard to get good grades, its not easy. Getting good grades aren't easy especially if you're in middle school or high school. At the same time you have to remember all those seven class what you need or don't need in each class. In language arts in hard for me especially when your friends in that class because all they want to do is talk and that's not part of getting a good grade. That's why is matters to pay attention. By getting it trouble or not listening in class other classmates think its funny. Some people think just because the way you talk or act it's funny it may be funny, but they might not know the real you. Some people think I'm a fake person that talks about everyone else I don't. If you knew me it would probably change your mind. See they way others think about someone should stop because there's other people that don't like that like me. People make bad choices and make mistakes but just think before you do something and don't let no one judge you because everyone is equally the same.
