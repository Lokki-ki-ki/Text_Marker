Some school offer programs that allow high school students to graduate in three years instead traditional four years. Must students who follow this plan must take courses during the summers or in the evenings or may not be able to take elective course. One reason that I agree with this chance that this programs it is offering. Because must students like me need to take the high school diploma and try to go to college or try to find job. When they have the high diploma ready. Must students take time during the summer to on focus in class or during the evenings. Because someone's students work k in the morning and the rest work during the evenings. But all these students want to go to college. This should the first reason why it could be a reason this program. Can allow the students get the high diploma done. Other reason this program that be offering this chance that must student get the diploma between three years should a very important opportunity to think in try to finish high school or try to enter to the college. Because is must students have the opportunity study and be ready to go to the college. Also should help them try to follow theirs goals what they want to be in the future this program is a good idea to must students. I very agree with this program and I support this chance that are offering to students.because we have to know wants to know what is better for and try to follow ours future choose what do you want to be in the life.These ones were ones of my support the students and agree that I am very agree that this program help the student grow up and finish high school. I really appreciate taking time and read may support and agrees thanks for all.
