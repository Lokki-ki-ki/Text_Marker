The first place I would want to go is the Bahamas because it seems like a wonderful place to go. That's the only place I dream of going. I would like going to the Bahamas because the sea life there. I like watching animal shows to see all the different colors, patterns and different types of fish in the sea. Furthermore, I also like turtles because they walk slow, and they look cool. The first thing I would do when I arrive at the Bahamas is buy goggles then go to the beach and run in the water to find Memo and Dory. I would probably document everything so when I get back home I'll have a memory from when I was at the Bahamas. I enjoy watching colorful fish swimming in crystal clear water. Furthermore, I like when there are all types of colorful fish in groups and swimming together. Furthermore, I also like stingrays because some of them flop on water, and it makes it look like they are flying. There are also sharks for example bull sharks, blue sharks, and make sharks. I also like the coral because they come in different shapes, sizes and colors. The coral I like the most is the coral that the clown fish hides in. I would love to go on a cruse and see dolphins and stingrays. I would love to visit with my family one day. I also like dolphins because they look cool when they jump out the water, and they dive back in. It will be cool if I learn how to surf in the Bahamas because it fun to explain to your friends that the first place you learned to surf at is the Bahamas. I bet if you stay there for a whole week you won't want to leave. I would probably be in to photography because of the sunsets and the beautiful place. It must be nice living there your whole life because of the nature.
