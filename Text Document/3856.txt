Do you agree or disagree about imagination being more important than knowledge ? I believe It's important to get peoples opinions on this question because I think Albert Einstein would be curious about what people think. Once they have chosen what they chose they could talk about it, give each other some details, also communicate with another, ask questions on to why they chose what they chose. I disagree wit Albert Einstein because imagination is something you imagine in your head or dreams it can be real only sometimes. I agree with knowledge because it happens in real life and when you do something you have the knowledge to know it right away. Students use their knowledge in school to learn about English. In school I use my knowledge by reading books and by reading I can understand what the book is talking about and I will know how I will write a short summary of the book. My second detail is I can use my knowledge in soccer because I can learn new skills and read a book all about soccer and I can understand that I can use my knowledge by knowing what reading is. Imagination wouldn't be more important than knowledge because the things that you will imagine probably won't come to real life. Imagination isn't a smart way to use the word important because it won't really help students, maybe even adults. Knowledge I know that it's a smart way to say important because it does help students in school, sports, maybe even with some decisions they will make in life. Albert Einstein probably asked us to agree or disagree with him because he wants to know what are thoughts are and would want students, adults, teachers to communicate with each other and talk about why they agreed or disagreed with him. In my conclusion I think students can succeed in life using knowledge because it's a smart decision to make in life by just thinking if it's a good or bad idea your knowledge could help make that good decision for you
