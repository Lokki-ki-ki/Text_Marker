The Author Waldo Emerson wrote "To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment". I agree with Waldo Emerson's quote because if there's someone that's trying to make you something that your not, being yourself will be a very daunting task. When I was in the 8th grade someone who I thought was one of my friends wanted me to change who I was because they though that I wasn't cool enough to hang out with anymore, at first I thought that I was the problem, but I learned that true friends won't try to change who you are, no Mather what. Being yourself is one of the hardest things you can try to do, possible because you to shy, you don't think your good enough, your scared of what others will think of you. I always hated thinking about myself because i never though that I was good enough for anyone or good enough to do anything, so I kept everything bottled up inside, at one point or another I even thought about killing myself but was too scared to do anything to try anything. So I decided acted like everything was ok until I tricked my self into believing that I was happy, but that didn't last. Now I'm in the 11th grade I came across a certen individuality(my current girlfriend) who, when I around, can't stop feeling real happiness. Every day, I think about how lucky I am to have met her. The Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote "To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment, as an individual I agree with his quote because in this world not everyone wants to see you sussed in your effects.
