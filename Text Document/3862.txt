"A problem is a chance for you to do your best", this phrase said by the American jazz legend Duke Ellington means that if you have a problem you can use it to improve yourself and I agree with this statement because problems can help you by making your brain grow up, giving you knowledge, and making your personality stronger. Problems make your brain to grow up, imagine being on a math test, and you don't know the answer, probably you will be scared but if you try hard to remember what is the answer you will find it, usually problems are too hard to solve, and this fact helps you to make your brain to think a way to solve the problems, this can cause your brain to grow up by using all your energy to think in what you can do in this situation. Problems gives you knowledge, there should be a reason for you to be in a problem, if you fight in the school or anywhere with another person, or you do something bad, probably someone will call you to the office or take you to the police department, if you are in a problem the first thing you will do is think on why this happened and this helps you because you will know what you did bad and will not do it again. Problems makes your personality stronger, if you crash your car you may feel bad and scared for this event, I had a test that it was hard and At that moment I felt bad, so most of the time when you have a problem you will feel stressed, this stress can be bad for your brain, but it can also help you to be more patient and determined in your goal that is solving your problem, with this two things your personality will be stronger that before the problem. In conclusion, I think that Duke Ellington is right because problems can help you by making your brain grow up, giving you knowledge, and making your personality stronger. So if you are in a problem you should take the lead of this situation and be determined in solving it, is not the end of the world only because you have a problem, and now you know that problems can help you.
