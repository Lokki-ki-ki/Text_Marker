People really work on this? Or People knows the importance to be better every day? People didn't know the importance to learn more, like give to their mind more wisdom, and they just conform with small pieces and very agree with this statement because it's true that if you don't learn more than you already know, you don't be able to be successful in life, and I was wrong all the time, and it's sad for me just realize that I waste a lot of time doing nothing and this question makes think a lot and the reason why is that I never think about to do something much better that I did already and sometimes if I have to do it, I'm afraid to fail or do something wrong, but small things do the difference and know something more that you already do it gives you more opportunities in life, and you grow more. Try something new that you have never done before it's something scary for humans it doesn't matter the age or how brave you are, if you had a lot of difficulties doing it; probably you will be scared if you have to do it again even if you already know how to do it for example, I have been working in a Japanese restaurant about one year and half, and it was the first time for me working as a server, and I was scared to do it and the reason why I decide to do it was the money, and I got surprise of myself because I made it and my boss was telling me that I was doing perfect job and I felt so proud of my self because at that time my English want perfect, and after I'm got problems with him about money, and it was too many problems, so I decide get another job my friend told me that her boss was looking for new servers, so I went to apply, but the problem was when I saw the size of the restaurant and the different with the other restaurant was a lot and also when I saw the menu in mind I was saying" You will fail"I feel too bad that day, and all the progress was long and suffering for all the mistakes that I made, but I made it one more time and today I'm thinking all that I went through it wasn't that much difficult, and I'm not a master, but I'm still learning. Many people are conformist with their life and don't want to learn more and unfortunately I include in that group of people, and it happens to me that I fail many times because think already know everything even more than others for example, One day I was taking a Spanish test and felt confident about it because my first language is Spanish and I remember the majority of my classmates were studying for that test but wasn't, and I fail the test because I saw questions that I never imagine that even exist and that was very important to get a credit so that day I learn that even if you know many things is always good learn more. In conclusion, you have to be better every day and know that is always more to learn every day, even if you know the stuff and always keep in your mind that try something new don't have to scare you because every human has the ability to learn and do the much that they want and the only obstacle you put it to your self.
