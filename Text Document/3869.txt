Occupations through internships and shadowing opportunities in companies. I had heard in my school that this company offer the students to visit and learn about the work that interest the student and I want to be one of them. You will want to know what do I have of special or different to the others' student s in my school; I will tell you why to should choose my instead to another student. I'm a daughter of a single mother with five children and possible only one will go to college and that child will not be me because I'm in the oldest of all my siblings, I'm also their second mom and I have to work and take care of them instead to go to college that's what my mom thinks. And if you give the opportunity to learn in your company my mom will change her mind to not put me in college and know that if I go to college and had my certificate it will be better to stay in home taking care of my siblings and work with a minimum salary when if I had the certificated I will have a better salary and I will be able to help even more in home and with a good job I can put my siblings into college too. Another reason is that I'm one of the best students in my school and I had never had problems in my school with anyone, either a teacher or a student. I will never do anything to hurt the company while I'm there learning something that can help me in my future job, and maybe you will have me working there after I finish college. You will be never feel like I waste your time, that will never happen I can secure that because I'm can be able to know how hard it's to choose a couple of students of many schools that you had investment. With my effort and my dedication I will really appreciate and do a good job on that visit. If you choose me you will be given me not only an opportunity to learn in your company, no you will be given me an opportunity to believe that I can do it, that I can success to be someone in this competitive world.
