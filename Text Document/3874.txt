Do you think that students should be able to take classes in school that benefits them in the Fulcher? In this paper I will argue that if students should take class that that will guide them towards a specific career. Should student consider their career pass at a young age, yes because when the student gets older and becomes an adult he or she won't have to have a boring and low paying job.I'm am in the eleventh grade and I already know that I want to be when in older, I want to be a U.S.M solder. The class that am I taking right now in high school that will help me become what I want to be when am older is ROTC. You may ask that is ROTC?ROTC is a class that teaches student about the United States Armed Forces. Another class that am I taking in my school that will help me with my Fulcher career is Econ and Finals. Econ and Finals is a class that is a high school requirement to graduate, but I like that class because I know that it's going to help me with my Fulcher career. What if we don't start preparing are self for are Fulcher careers after high school we'll be loss, confused, and broke too. In my family i don't think anyone does what they wanted to do i high school. I remember my mom telling me that she wanted to become an Aries, but she never became an Aries because in her old school they didn't have art, and she dropped out to have family. Working is something everyone has to do. So agree that it's a good idea to start finding something you would like to do when your older in high school, When I grow up I want to be a United Stated Marin solder and i know that the classes I'm taking will help me become that one day.
