Is it true that a positive attitude is a key to success in life?. Well, success is a strong word, there are some people that do not get where they want to be because the way they think. Our actions depend on how our thinking is. It is true that a positive attitude is a key to success in life, if you have a goal, and you really work hard to achieve it, you are always thinking "I can do it" and you are being positive about it, you have the idea that you will get whatever you want to get. In addition, there are many people who really want to get something or get to somewhere, but their minds are always thinking negative, they feel like they will not do good, or they will not success, it makes them not keep trying. For example, when I was in middle school I had a classmate who will always think he was a "looser" he will always say that he could not do anything, his parents did not love him, so many horrible things that will make feel sad, I always tried to make him feel better by saying positive things about him, but I think that is all about the ideas we put in our minds. Success depends on our actions too, sometimes we let other people decide for us, we either do what they said or we act the same way they act. Some of this people do not have a positive attitude to help you success. We create a plan that we have to work on to be successful, even though that we need to have a positive attitude. We have to make it happen no matter what, try as hard as you can! Because if you just have a positive attitude, but you are not trying hard an off, is not worth it, I seemed some people that are very good at something because that's all and the only thing they do :However they don't try to keep going further, and when they are in a situation that things are more challenging they give up! In conclusion; a positive attitude is an important key to success in life, on how comfortable you feel about yourself, and how successful you will be.
