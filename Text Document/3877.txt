My first impressions was when I come in on this country. Because I didn't know nothing me and my brother. We Didi't know how are the think, or how work, we didn't know how to speak the lenguageBut one day I say no more for everything no hero sad etc. And I say in my own I can do that to. Because I am a person, if the another people can do that, I can do that too. So my first step what I did to star. Was to learn the language, because the language is the most importuning. Because you can defend your self. If you learn the language you can do a lot thing. Like for example you can go to the store, and buy something that you like, or you can go to a restaurant, and buy whatever you like of food etc. Another thing what you can do with the language. Is to get an easy job, or you can meet a American friend. And had a normal conversation. For that I agree, that nothing is impossible because if I change my situation you can change your I know that is not easy but not is impossible all of that is going to help you to overcome your self for that you have to never give up.
