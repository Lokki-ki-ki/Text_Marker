Imagine walking into a classroom full of children just glaring at you, and you're teaching them a lesson that they have never heard of. A lesson I would teach to elementary students is about being active in life and why it's important to be active in life, and it's, doing sports or a physical activity, eating healthy, and going to the gym. Doing a sport is very important, because you are getting the exercise you need and losing weight. It is very important sports if you're a child, because children are young and energetic, so it is good for them to run around. Kids don't have to do sports, they can just go ride a bike around the neighborhood, go for a daily jog, and go ride a skateboard. This could be there daily exercise or weekly excessive. Eating healthy is very important, because you won't have a high chance of getting diabetes or heart disease. Kids should eat there vegetables too, because it won't make you gain a lot of weight. In my opinion I think vegetables are better than fruits. Children need to stay away from sugar, salt, and greasy food, because if you consume those types of foods it causes high blood pressure, which gives you headaches. This could benefit for the rest of their lives.Kids should go to the gym once in a while, because they can go on a treadmill for 10 minutes. Kids should lift dumbbells also, because it gets them stronger, and they could lift them at any size. Box jumps are perfect for leg strength, and it helps you with your athleticism and vertical. The gym is perfect for an exercise routine. I would teach elementary students about sports and why they need to do it, because it could benefit your life, and going to the gym is an even greater way to stay in shape.
