If you were looking for advice, would you take advice from one person or take advice from more than one person to get multiple opinions? I person think you should get advice form more than one person because getting advice from more than one person can give you more than one prospective on the situation you are trying to get advice on. Secondly why I think you should get your advise form other is that you get to pick out if the situation you are is bad for you or no like for example if you are in a risk taken situation that you think you should do, and you ask your mom if you should take the risk your mom might say no just to keep you safe but if you ask someone else that is a risk-taker they might tell you to take a change go thought with it. Lastly why I think you should ask for more than one person is that get advice form one person can lead to the right decision you are trying to make in that situation making the worn the choice can lead to hard times in your life and making the right choice can make your life much easier. In conclusion getting advice form more than one person can make you see the worn and right form other people advice.
