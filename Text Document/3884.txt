I think that homework clubs are good in school because, the students can take there time and process, to get to understand, there homework, students can finish early their homework and don't have to do it later, teacher can help more and teach more if that's there passion; what they like to do; to teach and want students to get good grades in there class or any class. Some students might not understand the homework or just can't each up. Students in homework club can each up or even can be finish with the unit that they are working on. Some students can be cached up a lot and help the one's that are not or the ones that can't go. For the teachers. Teachers that like showing kids more education, teachers that like helping students when there stuck in a problem, teachers that can stay after school that don't have nothing to do or does not have children. Those type on teachers can actually enjoy after school homework clubs. Teachers that actually like there work can go because some teachers is just there to teach, leave, and get there money but some, actually do like it they like helping when there wrong giving them corrections. Students can finish there homework early. Children sometimes can't do home work at home because they might be to busy or has a lot of activities go after school like soccer, baseball, basketball, etc. Some children might be able to go to after school homework clubs if there are after school buses but can't if there went homework clubs they would not be able to do there homework because, when they get home they have to take care of their brothers and sisters because mom works all day or sometimes parents might get sick and need them to take care or them. But after all I think it's good to have after school homework clubs to finish or get to understand if you don't. Sometimes when there's time left, and you did your homework and there like 20 or 10 minutes left they can show or teach you new topics.
