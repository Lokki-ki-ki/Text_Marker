It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change. In my opinion first impression might be possible to change because people are different human with different habits, and it depends on ourselves how we act and treat the person that we want to impress. For example Generic_Name wanted to apply for a job in a clothing company named Dior which is a popular, expensive,and fancy brand he prepares himself for his first interview, he wears black suit and black shoes and starts heading to the office with his CV he has enough experience to be one of the employer in the company he impresses his boss and that's how he gets his job. In addition to this statement the reason why the first impression is impossible is that the people did not meet each other more than once they do not know their habits what they like about each other or what they do in their daily life or what they like to do like their experience. In conclusion, I would say this statement is kind of equal disagree or agree because like I said people never know each other habits and what they like for example: what is their hobby, what they eat, what they like to wear, so at the end my opinion is I disagree with this statement.
