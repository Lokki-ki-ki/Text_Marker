Imagination is a thing all of us have some persons have more imagination than others, but I think we all have it somewhere, like my mother say "if you don't have imagination you would not be successful". I agree with what the scientist Albert Einstein said the imagination is more important than knowledge because you can have more fun, and you can discover a lot of new things, also you can enjoy life more. To begin with you can have more fun because you can be really entertained while creating new things like when you start a new project you can have a lot of ideas, and you can enjoy explaining them, or drawing them, you can have fun too when you are making those ideas come to life because you imagine them just how you want them, and you can have fun too by learning in the process something like you may not know, and you can apply them on your project just by using your imagination because you are the only one who knows how you want it.Also, you can discover new thing maybe you would not Know is the thing that you are creating could work, and there you can discover a lot of ways to work more well, or you can also discover, and learn more thing like what to use, or how to put thing right, but that's not the only thing, for what you can use your imagination for, you also can use it when you are drawing or writing histories like when you write you can discover a lot of knew words, or when you are drawing you can discover where you can put lines in the right spot, or at what measure, you also can discover how well you can draw.Finally, you can enjoy life more because you would not be so stressful, and you can enjoy imagine, and in my thoughts when you imagine you are in your own world you can imagine what ever you want, and you would not be worry about what the people is going to say about you, I think I'm an example of it because I like to draw a lot and when I'm thinking about what I want to draw I always forget about everything, and I really enjoy drawing, and I also like to go out a lot because of that because when I go out I see a lot of things and when I want to draw I always imagine them, and then I draw them more colorful than how I saw them and I really enjoy it. In conclusion imagination is more important than knowledge you can have knowledge but if you don't have imagination you won't see life the same because when you imagine you can have more fun, see life different, and you can discover a branch of new thing you would see life more colorful, and you can also enjoy life more how I already say you can have knowledge, and you can have and do a lot of things with it but if you have imagination you can have the whole world just by imagining.
