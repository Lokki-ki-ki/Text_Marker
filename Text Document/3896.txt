I think my characters' trait should be what I want it to be because I can make it whatever I want or whoever I want it to be. Making my character would be better because I would make it a great person, and it would be peaceful. Characters who influence beyond our control would be bad because it would cause them to do whatever they want, characters who influence would do bad stuff. Choosing my character would be better became I can learn from mistakes and do better off them, it would teach me how to be a good person. If my character was influenced it would be it would learn from its mistakes, it would do whatever it would want every day. Character being influenced would suck because it didn't choose its trait. It would just look around and do whatever one else is doing he would want to dress like everyone else, buy shoes like everyone else when he could just be him.
