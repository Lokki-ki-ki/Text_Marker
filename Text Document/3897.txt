I disagree with the students attend classes from home or video conferencing the reason why i disagree with this online thing is that one of are student will not get on, they will fall asleep, and they will not do there work the by them doing this a lot of kids can fail reason why I say these things because I know students I'm am one; that me explain to you why I say this. The first reason why I said students will not get on because they will be like I get on next time and keep on saying in till they think it is not useful at all then they will not get on and just go outside and play with their friends or sometimes there Mom or Dad have to keep telling to get on and they might not listen to them or just get on there PS4 or phone. Number two reason is that they can fall asleep while on it and the teacher cant do nothing about it but if we are at class a real class they can tell us to get up and make sure we're doing what we support to do by going to class that can make the teacher work way easier for them. Last reason but not least is that they will not do there work they will get on but how can you know they the one doing it they can get someone eyes that they know or just pay them to do it for them teen are bad but smart. However, other might say the students attend classes from home is the best thing they can do because they don't need to do all that morning things they can just open the laptop and join there teacher from the webcam and learn, but other cant learn like that they need someone right next to them, so the students can understand better. That why I disagree with these students attend schools from home.
