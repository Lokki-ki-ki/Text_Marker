Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of line or video conferencing. I think is not benefit for student, that take classes online because in the video maybe abilities, and don't have a teacher is not organized don't have partner when do you take the classes online. Teacher: when are you taking the video online you don't have a teacher for tell you what do you need to do in the class, and him can't help in your work for example the teacher can't help with Kahoot or Quizlet or with others strategies of work. Organized: when you take the class online you don't have organized, if you need highlights or pencil for write something for read it or explain your work. Partners: in the class you don't have partners or others people with you, just are with your teacher online, but is not your confidence or your friend like in the school the many people is your friends However; the people can say you can't take the class online because you work for ten hours for this you need to take the class online, but is not bad idea take the class, but you can't work or can't study after school with partner. Conclusion: you don't are prepared for take the class online worst is a video conferencing because you don't have teacher, organized, and partners in the end you can't take the class because it is more difficult for learning in your work. Is better take the class in the school you have more benefit how you can pass the class and more opportunities that the school have for you, and in the school you can help new students, and in the school you can protrude like better student in the school. Also, there are alternatives of take class online because the rare benefit.
