I agree that having a positive attitude is the key to success because in life no matter what you do you need a positive attitude. For example when you go for a job interview you go into the place with a positive attitude of you won't get the job. Its like getting a job you have to have a positive attitude when you're working with your others or with customers. I think that in life everyone needs a positive attitude to accomplish their goals. I think that people that doesn't have a positive attitude won't get very far in life. Because when I was in middle school I never had a positive attitude and I would get into a lot of trouble because of my attitude, and now that my attitude has change dim becoming successful in life. I think that in everything you do in life requires a positive attitude. You need a positive attitude when you're talking to people. If you have a negative attitude people wouldn't want to be bothered by you because people don't like to be around people with a negative attitude. For example when you have a positive attitude people would like to be around you then to be around someone with a negative attitude. Being positive is the key to success because if your being negative you're not going to be successful in life.
