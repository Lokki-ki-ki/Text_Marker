I agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson's "To be yourself in a world that OS constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."because, in this generation kids are trying to fit in with other kids, by changing the way that they speak or the way they dress. Kids also try to fit in by doing what other people tell them to do, making dumb decisions that could potentially end you up in jail or possibly something even worse effecting their future all because they wanted to fit in. Peer pressure is a main factor in kids that are trying to fit in. Kids pressure other kids into making poor decisions when in reality they don't want to do it but they want to look cool in front of others kids, so they do it anyway. In reality, it isn't cool to do what people tell you to do especially when it's just to fit in with others. In my opinion people shouldn't make poor decisions trying to fit in with the others, you should be yourself, it doesn't matter where you from or what type of clothes your wearing everyone should be accepted no matter who they are. Kids should be leaders not followers, you can end up with the wrong friends that couldn't care less about you, but are only with you because you make the poor decisions they're telling you to make. Kids should just be themselves, you don't have to try and fit in with the others, there are plenty of other kids with possibly the same interest as you.
