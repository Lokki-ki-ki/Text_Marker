"A problem is a chance for you to do your best" What I think about that quote is that you can't do your best in every problem. If your still stuck on what it even means like I was in the first few minutes of seeing that, It means that in every challenge you see in life there is always a way to try your best and get through that challenge, despite what your mind tells you because your mind is your biggest enemy you will ever face. I don't particularly agree with that quote just because in certain problems even if you try your best you will still fail or if you just don't want to do the problem or other people around you don't then you most likely fail to. What I'm trying to get at to this quote is that instead of being "For every problem there is a chance for you to do your best" it should be "For every problem or challenge there is always a way to get through it". Here are a few examples: If your dying from old age and your deadline is going to be this week. Then just die you get around the challenge by dying because in most regions there is something called heaven, so you can die and go to heaven. Another example: Facing a hard question, just guess! You'll have a 1/4th chance of getting it right and if you just guess it would be better then sitting on the problem for 20 minutes.
