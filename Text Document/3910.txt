Do you think that failure is the main thing for people consist on their goal's and success without lose their enthusiasm? I agree with the important role that failure play in the pursuit of success in life because, I think failure is the main key to people reach their goal's because they need to have the idea that after failure came the success, secondly they need to be positive and have in mind what they want and how they want to reach their success in life, and last they have to be prepared for failure, and they have to be prepared to confront the failure because they need to keep in mind that not everything is going to be in the way they want, but at the same time they always need to have in mind that everything is possible with effort. First, people need to have the idea that after failure came the success, because everything happens for a reason and if something goes wrong for certain reason at the moment when they try to success they need to accept things, and keep trying. They need to be really patience for example, when babies are trying to walk they fall many times but get up, and they keep trying until they reach their goal which in this case is walk or, there have been many cases when people have car accidents, and they lose the ability to walk that's something that does not stop them they keep trying even if you take more than a year they don't give up because their goal is to be able to walk again, their goal is to be the person they used to be before they get in that car accident, and they just want to be able to keep doing all the stuff they used to do before all the tragedy happens. Secondly, everything depends on how positive people are because, if they have a negative mind and always act like their goal's is something impossible to come true their not going to accomplish nothing because people need to have the idea that they can make true everything they want, they don't have to be thinking in failure cause the more you think, the more afraid you get to encourage yourself to make thing's happen, and they have to try every day to improve and look for the resources available to success in life. Finally, they always need to keep in mind that there always would be a chance of failure, and they have the right to be afraid but, that's something they need to live aside, and they need to be focus on their goal, they need to have the power to stop themselves whenever they want, and they have to be the ones to say to their self to stop when they think they already accomplish what they want but, they can't let people decide for them. Because sometimes people get jealous to see the other one's success in life, and they try to guide people into failure. In conclusion, there have been nothing that can't stop people to reach their goal's and success in life because everything is possible, people have to believe in them self and always be positive they always need to keep in mind that they are capable's of everything, and they need to learn to not give up. In that way they would be able to do everything and be successful the key is always have and excellent attitude and be prepared for people to judge, and be prepared to failure and get up and make it see like there have been nothing wrong and keep going. They need to be positive in every movement they make and be positive in the way that everything is going to be exactly how the planned.
