I know not all of us may have experience in every way. For example I may not be experienced in everything but as long as someone is their to help me I will be wiling to work and do what is needed. Some jobs look for the days they need their employees, Most places won't hire if you don't got what the job is actually looking for. It's better to find a place you find comfortable working at. Most jobs require-certain age experience availabilityMangers go for people who they see doing good in their job. For me, I know I have jobbed myself and it wasn't easy to find. I had no experience i didn't know anything. I was trained like every other employee at my job, But now I know a lot more positions. If my manager is low on staff he knows he can rely on me to come in and help, better for me, I make more hours which makes me happy knowing I'm making money for myself. Its better having a job where you get along with your employees. Find something your really interested. Don't choose something is going to make you miserable. One day there is going to be jobbed you'll have where they pay more than you will get paid for a part-time a you'll probably get more than $8 of course.
