Well people are use technology when they are sick or when they are busy doing their work at the office. But same people are using technology to do quick look at their email, look if someone is texting them form far distance like friends and family, checking if they got the job they sign up for, and the news what happened in the world. What people should do is to use technology for enmercy only because you can save someone life when they get into an accident. People should stop using technology for sign up for job's they should do it on person, so they can see how good are you in the job, if are you on time, and if you are it the right work. Some people love technology because it makes thing easier for them things to do. Most of the people are into technology. But the government has more new technology than us because they have the alert if the missile are coming to us or if the space is had a problem with the elite. And they can find out if someone is hacking the system of the president information, or they can hack the information of the government. Then people are going to make an app for security information. But mostly the technology is going to far with the app and the website's that now you don't know if you can trust them.
