Positive attitude is the key to success in life. I free with the statement of having "positive attitude is the key to success in life". Because people with a good positive attitude enjoying life better. Examples of enjoying better life with a positive attitudes are: people being more nation, respect on all, and hey live life with having less headache on their brains. People who do not have a positive attitude in life, they are not success to enjoy life in pace. One clearly example of people who does not have a positive attitudes are: they are always conflict with them self, they being disrespect to the people around, and they also are in more trouble and able to get headache constately. Another reason, why I agree keep positive attitude? Is because a good positive attitude is also helpful to our self, and we do not hurt or offend other people. Positive attitude such as a special key to make life better, more helpful and to treat other people nice.
