I think that Whataburger Ralph waldo wrote i don't agree because he said that what you already master you will never grow I think that with the more you mastered, the more you will know in life those things that you had masted are things that you want to do and get in life. You will understand more things like the more important thing like when you mastered driving one of the most important things to master in life that is the first gone u want to master in life and when u do you feel like you can do more thing once you have you get your drivers license. Or even as a kid when you mastered a video game you want to keep going keep getting challenged on each part of the game and when you finished on you buy another one, and it keeps going even when you die on the video game you still try to keep going on unless you get frustrated and mad, and you just give up and quit. Unless you keep trying you master the video game. The things that I had mastered was the most important one was driving its was hared for me just to get my permit and I guess it grow on me because I want to do more in life I want to be able to help my family and do what I can for my sisters and brother and my mom. Like out of all the thing I had mastered I say that is one of the thing I want to do because be able to go to college be something in life. So I say the more you master, the more you grow and know as a person. The reason why I think that the more you master, the more you grow its because out of all the things that I had gone throw I realized that as I'm getting older more and more changes that I will have to master will come my way in the future thing that I will want to master. I say this is why they make kids go to school, so they can learn more things so that we can be called and master things as we go throw school, so we can see the type of person that we want to be in life so that we can face challenges that's what I say the more things we master the more we grow so that we can learn from this thing.
