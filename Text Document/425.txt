1. Scientist Albert Einstein is wrong because imagination is not important because it won't help you with studying or anything like that, knowledge is more important than imagination because imagination is showing you some mental dumb images in your brain so it is not good for you, being knowledge is more helpful.2. Scientist Albert Einstein is trying to comparing about which is more important imagination or knowledge, but he said to himself that Imagination is more important than knowledge so I disagree because it is not right imagination is not going to help these kids being smart.3. Scientist Albert Einstein is trying to help these kids to be smart, but I don't think I agree that imagination is right because I just think that imagination can show you some images about like your just making a car right now, so I'm just gonna said maybe imagination is more important than knowledge maybe I said.4. Imagination probably is more important because it might sometimes show you images about something that your being smart something like that but I can't figure it out, being knowledge is more important but I guess not.5. For now I think Imagination is help for all the peoples I bet every scientist use they imagination to create something new, from now own I will use my imagination to think something smart that can help everyone.
