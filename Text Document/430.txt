On life's important matters is it best handling by yourself or seek help? They're two types of people, one follows his or her own ideas, and the other seek guidance. I strongly agree getting help form an expert or authority is much better than following your own instincts. Reasons are teacher and therapist; Both help out a lot in peoples life. For example my friend Generic_Name and me. Therapist help me when I was going through hard times. My family had split up, a good friend pass away, and I got bully in school, so many confusing and terrible events happening which teared me apart. Trying to work so hard fixing everything by myself, but none of my ideas work. Until I talk to a therapist about my problems. The therapist guide me to a better understanding of my life, and what to do next. Together we solve my problem with the bully in school, and help me got over my family split and my friend death. Secondly, my friend Generic_Name is a senior in high school. She was never good at math, nor did she pass the math SOL. Generic_Name had chances to retake the math sol to graduate. The next one she's taking will be the last SOL. Generic_Name study on her own and worked very hard. She is like to be self-reliance But at this point it was not working, so Generic_Name ask her math teacher to help out before the SOL. The teacher saw Generic_Name had a lots of mistakes, so the teacher guide her to fix it. Also teach her on the math problem she didn't know. Seeking guidance from the math teacher help Generic_Name pass the SOL. In conclusion getting help form experts or authorities help, in ways being self-reliance can't. Seeking guidance help a better understanding of the situation, less mistake, controlling stress, and learn something you did not know.
