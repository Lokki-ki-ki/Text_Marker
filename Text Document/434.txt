Is a good or bad idea to choose a career being young? To begin, in my opinion choose a career being a young student is a good idea because it is a great opportunity for them. Imagine people can choose their profession since their roughness. For example, if they think that they want to be a doctor and at that moment they do not like that profession, they can opt for other career on time. Also, taking that decision many people assure their future, for example if they know what to do when they come to the adult stage, they're going to be successful because they're going to learn many things since young, and that helps to get better their knowledge. Therefore, doing careers help to people to keep their mind busy in their careers and studying hard and using their time to do good things, like do not use drug or wasting their time being a vandal. As well, if all the people do it, the world will be a place full of privilege, with professional people around, having trust and support on each other. To conclude, doing career is one of many opportunities that we have in this country, so we have to use it, because it helps us to be good person and get better our skills to be a professional. Furthermore, we have to learn how to focus on really important things. Also, it teaches us how to become a successful human and fight for our goals since young. As well, it is good to learn how to be an independent person because if you study hard, your future will be full of success, so you do not need other people to do anything you want.
