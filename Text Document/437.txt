I think it is a good idea because if you finished with the career that you took, you have more time to take another career, you can start a project at a very young age and if these project did not work you have more time to try it again. First, if you studied a career that you like before and now you don't like it, you have another options or opportunities to take another career for example, I have a friend she is 22 years old, she will to graduate the next year at the age of 23, she is very young, and she is thinking to take another career that make her more professional. Then, if you want to start a project you have a lot of ideas because the mind of the young people is incredible and if you fail it you can try and try again for instance If you want to start a project like, you want people to work for you, you can start something easy like clean houses and the money that you earn from that then you pay to them, or you can put a store of clothes, and you can to make your own company of clothes, or you can have a restaurant and earn s extra money for these works. They can study and work at the same time and earn money to pay his or her college, they can start a family while they are taking another career and if they learn a lot of things they have their own life. Finally, I think it is a good but good idea because they become more professionals, and they have more chances to have a great life, If you see more of the students are young, and they work hard to have an amazing life, it is a good idea because you can help people to give them motivation, and they can see you like an inspiration to go ahead.
