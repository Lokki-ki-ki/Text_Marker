I agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson when he wrote, "Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow". You need to show to everyone what are your ambition to improve your life, and if you don't show to the World what you can effort, do not put any complain to someone else for your fault. You always want to know what are your own limits. First, I think what he is trying to say with" Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow" is always have big dreams bigger than you and have big ambition too. That you always work hard and know your position and show to everyone how you get there, because is not easy go to the top and keep the place, and most of the people give up, and not showing us their goals complete. Second, do not put any complain to someone else for your fault, that you did, you did think what it's the best way for you, and don't take it like a loss, take it like you get more experience in life, and It's not always happiness have sadness too, but always you are getting more knowledge to know how to do that next time, and show to the world how you get there. Third, people always have challenging on their life that cause that people always want to know what are their limits, so they always push themselves to know what are their limits until they can't anymore. Then, they try to overpass their limits working hardest than anyone, sacrificing themselves, and living their pride to stay at the top or to go at the top. In my opinion, everyone has the right to improve their life that only they need It's to be more confidence than It's to do not to give up and push themselves in other words being perseverance to overpass their limits thinking always in big, and leave a legacy for the next generation.
