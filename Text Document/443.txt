Generic_Name was a student that likes to go to school, he woke up every morning like a normal student does, but the thing is that Generic_Name do not like is work on his own he prefers work in a group and not by its self because he likes to distract others by talking, playing, be in his phone instead on what he needs to focus on. The time keeps going and going. One day a wise person said" The time keeps going and going and wait for nobody.'' There was another guy called Generic_Name. Generic_Name against work as a group because he knows that is a distraction, and he do not likes to have bad grades. Generic_Name made a scientific experiment his experiment is based on the idea of work in a group or work alone. He talks with his teacher and explain his idea, the teacher agree with Generic_Name's idea. The teacher gives a worksheet to the student that were in the class and the teacher said you may work on your own or in a group. The result was like Generic_Name thoughts were like, the students who work by themselves demonstrate good work, perfect scores, and they did not take long time to finish the work, and they were able to help others students. But the other group of students who choose work as group they show something different from the other students that work by themselves, they did not finish the work, others not even start the work between those groups was Generic_Name. One day Generic_Name met Generic_Name at his house to play a video game. Generic_Name went to Generic_Name house, and they start playing the game, while they are playing Generic_Name start ask a lot of question between those question he asks. Why you always work by your self? And not work in a group?he laughs and answer the questions.
