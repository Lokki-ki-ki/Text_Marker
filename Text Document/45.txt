I think yes, that if you have a positive attitude it is a key to success why do I think that? I think that If you have a positive attitude you won't get in trouble because the attitude that you give out is the way that people judge you, A positive attitude is a great way to get the things you want in life like for example, If you want to get a job or a career you have to have a good and positive attitude because if not then they will not accept you like for another example if you have a positive attitude you can make friends and people will like you because of the way you are if your kind people will be like "wow this person is so nice and kind" I just think that being kind and nice is the best way to be in life you don't really get in trouble because your attitudes nice and not rude and about things that people tell you or want you to do in the other hand if your rude and people will look and you and think about you in a rude way and not like you. The reasons I feel like a positive attitude is good because I am a kind person and don't get in to trouble with none because there is no reason to be mad and angry about small stuff. I fell like other people might think different about what I think because we all think different about everything. If you go to a friends house, and you be all mean and rude and all dirty people are not going to like you because of the way you are and the other hand if you are all nice people they will like you because of how you are you and that you have respect of how your attitude is if not then you will not be wanted by people because of you act and are and people who act all rude end up in places they never thought they would end up in I just saying stay with a positive attitude in the world, and you will succeed in life and be great and not have to go through stuff like get in to fights or locked up in jail. I meant I know some people that have bad attitude and life, and they are doing great in life, but there is going to be one day that you will get in a problem by the way you act I think that just stay with a positive attitude so you don't got to worry about anything's and that its just better way to get all the things you need and would like to active in life because why be all rude when you can just be sweet and caring then be all grumpy and mad about small little things that can be fixed because that's what I think but if you have a bad attitude you might like to end up saying or doing something that you will regret like if your like taking and with an attitude you might end up saying stuff that you don't mean and if your normal and calm about stuff you don't go to worry about nothing. I have also been told that if your have a great attitude you won't have to worry about stuff because why would someone care about how you are if you're all nice and not rude.
