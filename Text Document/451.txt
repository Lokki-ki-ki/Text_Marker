Today, I will be talking about if weather or not students should be committing to a career at a young age. Do you think it is a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age? Therefore, some students still wouldn't commit to a career. Although some say, It is not a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age. Actually, It is a good idea for students to commit to career at a young age. But some people think, It is not a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age. A reason they have for that is that, The students that don't commit to a career early won't have to start paying bills. But I personally Think It is a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age. Because, If students commit to a career at a young age they will learn to be independent then students that don't start a career at a young age. This is what people said about not committing to a career at a young age. Therefore, What I think is the opposite of what they think. I think it is a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age. Because, If they commit to a career, They will start to make money earlier the students that don't commit to a career. But, Another reason why people think it is not a good idea for students not to start a career at a young age is, Because the students will start paying less attention in school and in class. This is why I think students should start a career at a young age. What some other people said about, it is not a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age. Is because students would be tired in school. Students would be stressing over school and work at the same time. But, What some other people said about, It is a good idea for students to commit to career at a young age. Students would have money of their own to buy the stuff they need. They would start leaving independently at a very young. These are some reasons people gave for both sides. Although some say, It is not a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age. Actually, It is a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age. Students would be able to start living independently. It is a good idea for students RO commit to a career at a young age. This is why I think students should be committed to a career at a young age.
