I agree with Churchill's statement about the role of failure, because failure is a next step for success. The reasons why I agree with Churchill's statement is because, without failure we may not know how to be thankful for it if we pass in the first place, failure shows us what did everything went wrong and how to make it right for the next challenge we face, failure tell us or show us why are we doing it. For example, most of the people fail in like every second, but there is no shame in failure because the more we fail, the more we know. My father once told me that "no matter how many times you fail it doesn't mean it's the end of the world". Failure is a reason why our life is hard or unsuccessful, but failure also shows us why are we doing this ?why do we want this or how hard do we have to try to be successful. Our brains gets bigger from failure and when I mean bigger I mean more details or more information. So I agree with Churchill's statement, failure does do the important rule of the pursuit of success.
