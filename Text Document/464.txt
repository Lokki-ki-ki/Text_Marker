Think about a talent or a skill that you have. What did you do to develop that talent or skill? How do you use it? A talent or skill that I have developed is being able to write in cursive. I develop and use this talent in many ways. In order to develop this talent and use this talent, firstly, I had to practice every single day, observe many other people write in cursive, and lastly I use it to sign many items. One way I developed this skill is practicing. I used to spend everyday writing the whole entire alphabet in cursive to perfect how I wrote. I would meet up with my teacher after school every day for about a month so that she could help me work on my writing. Another thing that I did was rewrite every document or letter that I saw or received to accomplish writing as good as the original writer. Another way I developed this skill is by observing other people. I would watch many "How To" YouTube videos to observe how other people wrote. I would observe how they wrote, and I would write very similar to them. Whenever I saw anybody writing in cursive I would study their hand movements and match mine up to theirs to achieve writing perfectly. Any letters that I had received from family members I would examine to figure out how they wrote in such a perfect manner. One way I have used this skill is by signing my name on many items. Anytime that I go to the doctor's office I get asked to sign my name and knowing cursive comes in handy. Whenever I decide to write letters to my family I sign my name on the outside of the envelope, so they know that it's from me. Also, anything I have painted or drawn has my name signed on it. Think back at a skill or talent that you have. How did you develop it? How do you use it? Mine is being able to write in cursive. What's yours?
