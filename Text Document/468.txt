Why is it important to learn the experience from others? It's important because you know what you're going to do, or you know what you're going to see. For example when my cousin went to another country she told me about her experience, and that puts a thought to my head of she did and what she saw. Therefore, when I went to the country she went I experienced what she did and what she saw. When your friends or family members share their experience with you, you start to imagine what they've experienced and that sometimes leads to preparing because they've told you what they've experienced from them, they can prepare you. For example your family has a thing where all the boys in the family try out for basket ball, and you ask your older cousin how was their experience went and what they did good and bad. So you know what the coach wants to see and what he doesn't want to see that means you can show off to the coach and that can help you make the team and make your family proud and keeping the legacy going and when you can share your experienced with your brother when it's his time to shine. Learning from others experience leads to good things like making a team, preparing,proving people wrong, improving, and some lead to bad things like you're a new student and a bunch of girls see you're hanging out with a girl who has had bad experience with them come up to you and tell you about their experience with the girl, and that makes you think she's so nice and that makes you not want to be her friend from the experience with her, or your best friend, and you have the same science teacher but different blocks and your best friend tells you that the science teacher is very nice and when it gets time to go to your science class the teacher isn't as present as your best friend shared with you.
