In my opinion, I do believe that it should be an elective classes for students to take art, drama, and music classes because it has nothing to do with our education. It won't help us in the future because all you need to learn is how to get a good job, pay for bill and electricity, food, gas, and water. It has nothing to do with our, and it should be optional for students to take any art classes whenever they like the class and the second reason is that students might not like the classes because they will be not be interested and will be bored because art is really not their thing. Students like to listen to music, party, go on social media, sports, video games, talking to friends, and being cool. But they don't want to sit in class with a bunch of nerds that paint, make clay and draw. Students should not be required to take a class they don't like. It should be optional just like band class. Some students might fail the class because they either don't like being there and just skip the class, or they're not that good at making clay or drawing. For drama, it should be optional too since all you do is make an act and speech, and it has nothing to do in students futures. Music class is what students will find most interesting, but it has nothing to do with students futures either. These classes are something that are easy, Something that you are good at, and something that interests you. So in my opinion it should be elective classes and not classes that should be required to graduate.
