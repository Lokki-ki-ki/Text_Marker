Students and Families should be left to decide if they want to get involved in extracurricular activities. Students should know what they want to do like get involved in more or less extracurricular activities. Teachers say students get stressed over more extracurricular activities. That is not true students do not get stressed over extracurricular activities. Students should have their own choice if they wish to take ore extracurricular work. Students and Families should be allowed to pick if they want ht o continue extracurricular activities or not, and if it is too much for the student to handle in one day. Because the overload of activities they do. I believe the school should not get involved at all and let the students have responsibilities to handle their situation. For example a student will be able to decide whether they wish to take an extracurricular activities' event. Students have reasons on why they should be able to settle it with their families. One of those reasons is that the parents can pick what's a safe and valuable extracurricular activity for their child. Another reason would be is that a Student would prefer a parent to be their instead of a teacher.
