We as high school students should make our own decisions for classes. But for younger age kids, we should pick there classes as teachers, and they will just need to do the work. Kids that are young will not have the option for drama until they are in high school or middle school. Students should have the right to pick a class because It's what they want to learn about. It should not be required, the school should make you take a class that you may not like. We as Students can make these type of decisions, or we can choose something new, Students can pick new classes and learn something new. School's should make these Kids take these certain type of classes because it helps you and its mandatory. For example, if you take art class then you will need to take drama class too. Both of these classes will help each other, and you will have background knowledge. The school is basically trying to help you by doing this method. At the end of the day whatever method your school does, you're going to have to listen to them and comply by the rules. It's really not hard, unless you are not trying to graduate. Also, if you are not feeling a class or you just don't like it then you can talk to your councilor or a trusted adult in your school.
