I would like to work at a company because there you can work with more than one worker and have your owed iffiest, and you can be doing work with you worker and get help if you need help from your workers and If you allow me to visit it can be changed in your companies. Allow students to visit can help your partnerships with schools and students mine work at your companies or organizations companies can get a lot of help from students if to allow them to visit some companies need a good idea if you last students visit the can give some good ideas for your companies and you organizations. Why I chose working for a company is because I like to talk with other workers and have fun while I am in work and I like working with others so this is the best job and the best chose for my companies to chose me. Student like to be with their friends at work, so this is the best job for the student that like to be with the friends at work and have fun if you have a group of friends this mine be the best job for all of you. Local workplace is for you if you don't have group of friends chose this job for this dais. Companies should allow students to visit the companies or the job you with to work for all the jobs would allow students to visit it. But some job are east. I need to pass
