After reading the prompt I might think we have to make some change to the school like, what was said in the prompt we have to change the school days to a four-day school week and make them to be two hours long. It can give people the hours that they need for other things and can give them time for project and stuff of that matter. The reasons why, I think we should do this because we can get more hours in the day to do things like for example: sports, homework,helping others, getting more rest in the day because maybe some people might not get more sleep during the night, some people might have job, students might have to go with their parents on a trip to somewhere or some place or also a school trip that they might go on. I will think that this is a good position to be for the change of the hours but to ever good thing there must be a bad like, a bump in the straight road ahead of you. I think for myself I do agree, but there are some people that might not agree with my train of thoughts. The people who many not agree will probably say that there are not many hours in school to do things like learning new things. My train of thought that we must go this way of the four-day school week plan. There are so many beliefs of going this way that means we can save more resources and teachers can plan things up ahead for his/her students. I must say that there are some disadvantages of students having a four-day week of school like students forgetting the things that they were taught in class and students can also not be ready for class. Some in conclusion: there are bad and good thing of having a four-day week of school plan, but there are some disadvantages of having it like what I said people might disagree with you but don't let them change your own train of thoughts. People also might not agree with your own believes but don't let them change who you are, but the disadvantages are hard, but the students can probably something's pull it off.
