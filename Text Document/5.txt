Dear Principal,Our school should have a community center. The reasons why, are so students can learn what our community needs, how to make our community better place, and why is community important for students to know. It's a great to have a community center to know how we can make things better.Students think community center takes their time away. But they have to learn what our community needs. Students will participate in a group of students making a list what our community needs, therefore students will learn what our community needs! Students will present their list of things our community needs! Due to that students will be giving extra credit for the ones who have low grades!Some students don't participate because their friends say its waste of time. It would not be waste of time when you get to know how our community can be a better place for us. Students should know that the program is about our own lives, because if our community is bad well our lives are going to be bad. Due to that students will want to participate and will want to make our community a better place for us.Some student might say why is the community important anyway, were fine nothing is wrong. But when get to know what our community is, they would want to know about and would want to participate and know why is our community important. Students will receive a good grade if they participate in this community because is like an extra credit. Due to that their friends would want to enjoy the program because their friend told them about it.So principal the community center will be a great place for students to learn lots of things. So I guess this will be a good idea for our school. Students will learn what our community needs, how to make our community a better place, and why is our community important!Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
