Research shows that 75% of individuals agree on Emerson's statement. Well I disagree because you can become better, try is over and over again, and don't bring yourself down. First and foremost, why I disagree is because you can become better. For example, you mastered a project, but you want it better than what you did before look at your project closely. Write on a piece of paper on what you have then planned out your other idea. Don't make it identical make it different. Show people that you can do it but twice as better. So you can be proud of yourself and people can be proud of you too. Furthermore, why I disagree is because you should try it over and over again. For example, you mastered you project, but you challenged yourself to do it twice as better. We all understand doing something better than what you already have can be a little complicated That's why you should try it over and over again, so you can accomplish it. That can help a lot to be honest you can see where you made a mistake and not commit it again. Last but not least, why I disagree is because you should never bring yourself down. For example, people are getting so frustrated that they will say I can't any more I won't be able to do it. That's bringing yourself down you should remain calm. Don't fell pressured at the end of the day you will do it, and you will feel really proud of all the hard work you did. Don't ever never say you have to trust yourself if you don't then who will trust you.These is my three reasons on why I disagree on Emerson's statement because you can become better, try it over and over again, and don't bring yourself down.
