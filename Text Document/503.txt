I agree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson, about being yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment, because people always say that they love you and care about you for who you are, but the truth is that. When you're yourself with them and show them who you really are, they want to change you. Some people are always going to talk and pay more attention to the mistakes that you made instead of what you have to offer, being yourself in this world is the most important hing in life, because you got to show them that you like who you are, and you don't care what they say, love yourself inside and outside never stop doing what you love just because people told not to do it, do what makes you happy not what makes other people happy. Don't be afraid to show the world what you got to offer, you only live once, feeling good about yourself is more important than satisfied other people.
