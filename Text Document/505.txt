I disagree with extending the school days, because is too much for the students and teachers, also not fair for teachers to work more them they do, and finally not that good because all the other schools are going to get earlier. Having not much sleep can effect students grades and classwork, This can effect teachers also just like the students. Students wouldn't feel that well with adding one and half hours to school, because they need to study and rest well. Adding all that time to school would affect after school activities, because students would not feel like they had much sleep, or they did not study for something that is due for school the next day. Students would not feel well rested because they had to wake up at an early time and then coming back to school, after they come back from school students are looking forward for a nap, but they can't because they have chores to do. Another thing is that students would not have time to do their chores that their parents told them to do, because they have homework or have to go to their soccer, swim or gymnastic practice. Adding one and half hours to school would affect the students a lot with activities and school work and also their sleep. One more thing this would affect teachers work because they have to leave school later than before. Also, teachers would not have much time with their family afterwards. Another thing is that teacher are going to have to work even more in their things for the classwork. It would also make it difficult for them because they are going to have to spend more time in school instead with their kids or family. And this is why I strongly disagree with adding one and half hours to school days.
