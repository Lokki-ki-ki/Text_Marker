First impression is an effect a feeling, a feeling that can be changed, for example "love" sometimes you can look at someone and think you can be with them forever and love them, because you have that impression that feeling, that they will never do such harm and leave you because they think problems can't get solved but once you noticed that it can, but the other person doesn't see that you can realize that is really worth it, to keep having that person that thinks problems can't be solved and always thinking negative. At first impression you would think that bad things couldn't ever happen because you were so in loved and so attached then you see that things change. So I think is possible to change your first impression and what you really thought about that person. It's really sad to believe or think that you were right on your first impression, and then you see that it hurts when people leave you because you feel betrayed, you never had that feeling that your significant other would just quit on you and not try to work things out when that was all that matter.
