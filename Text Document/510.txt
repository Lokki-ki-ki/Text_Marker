Do you think students taking an elective class is a good idea? Will I think it's a great for kids to art as an elective class because some kids love to draw, others can learn how to draw and even use it in real life situation? So these are the reasons why I think taking art as an elective is a good idea. Some students will love taking art as an elective because they love to draw. Students will love taking art during school. For example, my friend never had time to work on her art projects after school; therefore, she had a talk with her counselor, so she can get put in an art class. Once she got into the art class she had more time to work on her art projects in school. She was also doing something she is good at while getting a grade for it. Students can learn how to draw if they had an art class. Some students want to learn how to draw, but never had a chance to. Therefore, if the school give students an art class they can really learn a lot. Art is not only about drawing; however, some students don't know that. One day, my mom took an art class because she wants to learn how to draw. But the art class didn't just teacher her how to draw. She got to learn about the history of art wish is pretty amazing. Some people think taking art as an elective is not a good idea because students not going to need art once they are done with school. I disagree because some students might wan to become an artist later on in life. I know a lot of artists who making a lot of money just by drawing. Students who might want to take art can become famous one day. So taking art class as an elective is a great idea for students. These are the reason why I think students should have art as an elective class some students love to drawn, some students want to learn, others can even use in life. Art is a great thing so why not enjoy it.
