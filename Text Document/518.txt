School's should not extend a school day by two hours and have a three-day weekend. Just to conserve energy and resources. Students would have to work a lot harder. Student would also have more responsibility. Student already hate school and are already exhausted when they get home from a seven-hour school day. So why add another two hours to there day. This would cause a kid a lot more stress because of the extra amount of work they would have to do, keeping there grade up and staying forces on there school work. Plus they would still have to come home and do there homework or any work they didn't finish in class.Also, some student might have a lot more of responsibility to do and adding another two hours would just stress them out with the amount of work. Like what if the kid was doing some after school activities, the kid would be too tired to do any clubs or sports. Students would also be unmotivated to get job because they would have the time or energy to work. Some would say that it would a good idea to extend the school days by two hours because of the extra day off they'll get, and because of all the energy and resources they'll be saving, but wearing out the kids by giving them extra work to do. Stressing them out moral not worth it. So in conclusion I don't think schools should extend there days and give us another day off. It would be too stressful and to tiring. Student need time to go home after school and rest, and have a few days to rest.
