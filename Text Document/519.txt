An Old Proverb Says Honesty Is The Best Policy agree about being honest at all times. Because that's how I was taught and even though I get in trouble, when I'm honest it's better than lying. Because lying can get you in to worst trouble. If your always honest people can always trust you and who doesn't want to be trusted? My grandma always told me that when you do something bad or lie karma is going to bite you hard. But, sometimes you're going to have to lie for an important reason like hurting someone's feelings, I think it's a horrible feeling to hurt someone's feelings am I right?However, when your honest people will always respect you, like you, and honer you. For an example this has happened to me if you're at school and your at lunch and everyone is supposed to be quiet and you and your friend start talking, a teacher calls both of you over, and she said,"were you guys talking" my friend said no, and I said yes I was talking, and the teacher said, "thank you for being honest you can go back and finish your lunch" but, my friend got in trouble. See that's why it's always good to be honest people will respect you more.
