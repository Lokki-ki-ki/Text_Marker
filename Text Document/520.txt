We should perform community service because we are helping our society to become much cleaner. For examples I can give are, help janitors to clean litter from school, help the teachers by tutoring kids, go to the library to help clean and organize it so I could look perfect when kids come to the library, and to go to the hospitals to help patients, and so we can help clean the hospital. That's why I think we all should perform community service.
