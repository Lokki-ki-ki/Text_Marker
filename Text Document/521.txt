Which is better Working with a group or working alone, Some people may say working in a group is more Beneficial than working all alone. Sharing answers, Help each other if stuck in problem, and get to finish on Time. First, Working with a group is more Benefit than working all alone, Because sharing answers helps me learn New thins to learn about new answers to think about because Iâ€™m not that good at English speaking, For example I got Generic_Name, My English 11 Teacher Gives the hole class a paper to Read and answer, By the time I finish reading I ask my teacher if I could let Generic_Name to be my partner, so we could help each other and get it done on time by helping each other and share our answer to see a different thoughts of each one of us, Secondley, Working with a group is more Benefit than working all alone, Because It's fun to work with a person or more, For example in History Class, when the teacher got to let us do class work for tomorrow exam or test, she let us do a group of 4 and do a challenge in a computer, so we could learn and do fun in the same time. Third, Working with a group is more Benefit than working all alone. Because Students could finish their work on time, Foe Example Last week me and Generic_Name we got a project is Due in two day in History class, We worked together and reachers a different thing and write a diff rents thought and even different answers and we compound all of our answers and finish on time with diff rents thoughts. Conclution, Some people may say Working with a group is more Benefit than working all alone, But Sometimes I like to work a lone because I could think of my answers and question and even could get my own grade but sometimes when I work in a group when I try to work and care about my work but the rest of my group does not care so if nobody has worked then the hole group will get a zero even the person who worked.
