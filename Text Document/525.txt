The program is good in many ways such as: helping each other with homework, getting to know each other, and also it is lots of fun.Homework can be hard on every student no matter the age. It is a lot better to have someone help you rather than being stuck and angry about the fact you don't get the topic. The older students can help the younger ones with their homework. Most likely they would have already learned the topic. Maybe they could even explain it in a better way for that student. They can all get to know each other. I love meeting older students. I get to ask about what they are learning in school. Furthermore, I could ask about their homework or how their school is like. You could ask them how growing up has changed them. You will be friends and get to know a lot about each other. You may even have a lifelong friendship in your hands. My last reason is having fun. I am in a program like this myself at my school. I get to in a classroom with high school students. They are so much FUN! We play together, learn together, and help each other out. I love it so much and every school across the country should offer an after school program like this. A program after school where older and younger students hang out is a very good idea. Students can help each other with homework and get to know each other all while having fun. I believe this is a very good program for the good of all students no matter the age or grade. If you are looking for a way to learn and have fun ask someone in charge to offer a program like this at your school.
