I agree because it is important to have a positive attitude, and it is better to be positive Thant negative, because if someone wants to talk to you, a want some advice and him give you a negative answer, the other person will be negative, but does the person give him a positive answer then the other person will be happy, and will try to do his best to stay positive, but some people don't like to be positive, and always are band a negative person on everything, they are person that if you tell them something, they will answer angry, and don't like to make friendship, for example if you are new in a school, and you don't have friends then, you will try to make friends positively, and it will work because you are don't band a negative person to others, second example is that the person is someone negative and the other person also, they will be fights and discussion on each other, that's why people have to be positive and sure one everything
