A person can fix his first impression if that person was not notified about what struggles was happened the other person that day, for example when the Algebra teacher meet Generic_Name, he said that Generic_Name was quiet because Generic_Name do not like talk too much, one day Generic_Name said that he just come from El Salvador and do not speak too much English and a person that has lost a family-member if someone tried to meet him on those days anyone will be said that he's must depress or sad because none of them know the truth. People can not judge other just in one day. For decades people have been said that first impression are impossible to fixed. A person can change that first impression if they share about their hobbies, characteristics, and tastes and if that person was no in a good mood that day they meet.
