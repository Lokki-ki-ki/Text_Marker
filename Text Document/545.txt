"Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow"I think this is wrong because if you commit a mistake, and you want to fix you can't due no matter what happen you always have a second change to grow. Firts, Im explain my topic with details a person who is due something for class always need help for others student's for example: All the students have different opinions, but only one is the leader of the work they must be discussed the problem and star working. The people on the group don't have the same idea that the others have the work is most finish but is not good enough, they present the work but is not good, the leader say I don't accept this work because is incomplete the students talk more the topic, and they star working again in the problem. The people in the group never say I don't want to do this work, becuase all the people have to prove her self, they say maybe the work is not good, but we can't make this again, you never have to felt that you can't not due because you can't grow no matter what happen you can't due again and star again. Second, In situations you feet that the things that you due or make are wrong, but in not because the all the people in this world have a second or three changes to improve, and if you make a mistake first is not matter that you have to make the same mistake again, you must be improved your self, world,class, and the people that you have you never have to feel grow because that word is not exist for a person who every day is trying to make a good work. My other example is a person who is guilty to do a crimes and this person wants to have an education to grow like a human that we are they must be giving the opportunity to study no matter what he is due or make because all the people have the same straight. I know that many people are gone to be upset with me because they must think, a person who make a crimes don't need a second change but for my opinion they have a second change because they are in jail for the crimes and the want to grow to be a better person. All the people in the world have a second change because if you make something that you are not prove you must be make that again you never have to say I don't want to do this ORI don't have a might to make this, that is wrong you can't due everything in this world is possible, and I know that this people are annoyance for what I think but is only my opinion because nobody want to be in jail and never learn something for your future, the people who are upset with me why they don't think if you are in the same situation you have to think in you and also the other people to make this world a little better. In my conclusion, the people have always a second change to grow, the human that we are we have to think in us but also in the others' person like example: this text is for a world to make this a better place to live, because all the people in this country is fortunate because have so many opportunities to grown and be prepared for the future in other hand I come from a country that don't have opportunities, but my goal is to be a better person today, tomorrow and for my future.
