An old proverb says honesty is the best policy. However, it might hurt a person's feeling. Well I disagree with that because, what if someone came up to you and said, my mom bought me this dress and said it looks good at me and asked you if it looks good on her. Well what if you said no it looks ugly for you then, the girl will be hurt and would think that her mom lied to her and will start crying.Another reason is, what if your friend got in trouble and said he didn't do it but, you knew he did it and the teacher ask you if he did it, and you said yes. Well their're something's that could happen to you First, nobody will trust you Second, the kid that you snitched on won't be your friend and won't talk to you forever Lastly, everyone will call you a snitch because you snitch on you friend.However, if someone said to you or wrote it to you that they were going to shoot the school. That's when you could tell the principle or the office because, shooting a school is something serious that could scare people and if you didn't tell the office or the principle, and it happens well it will be something that you will need to live with for the rest of your life because you didn't tell the principle or the office that there was going to be a school shooting.
