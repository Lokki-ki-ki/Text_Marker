I agree with honesty because it can end so many problems. So they don't have to build up and cause a lot of damage. Another reason why I agree is that you don't have to lie even more to cover what you already lied about. And it It's hard to catch up with Youâ€™re lying it can also get confusing, and you can get caught lying to their face. The last thing is if you get caught lying it can cause more problems with the person and can lead to more issues. It can also help the other person to trust you. If the person trust you don't have to lie to them so it won't hurt there feeling. Also, you can lose someone trust or lose the realashinship you have with them. It can also hurt a lot of other people that u care about. Lying can cause you to look bad in front of people. And ID it hurts there feeling you can solve them because you told the truth.Also, it can help you to stop lying and get better at telling the truth, so everyone can trust you. And that's the reason why I think honesty ID the best policy
