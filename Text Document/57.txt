Do you think fail is good? In this paper I will argue failure and success in life. Some people get sad when they fail something, they try to not loss the enthusiasm, sometimes people get mad by them self. First, people get sad when they fail something, because they try the best, so they can get everything right as they doe, and maybe they never image that they going to fail, and sometimes some persons cry because they fail. Second, some people try to not loss the enthusiasm when they fail at the first time, because maybe they have a good positive, and they said that the next time they do not going to fail, so it's mean that they not lost the enthusiasm at the first time they fail. Last one, person get mad by his or her self, because they think they don't do well, and they get really mad when they fail for a little error they have, but that get that they are learning because the errors that person have made them learn. Some people said that failure is a bad idea for success. But some people don't loss the enthusiasm as they have been falling and that made the person won for those who said that failure is a bad an idea because the person that don't loss the enthusiasm is keep going until they make sure to not fail anymore, and as they have been falling they have been learning. In conclusion, for some people failure is a bad idea.
