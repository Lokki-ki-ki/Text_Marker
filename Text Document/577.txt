It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change. I personally disagree with this statement because, many times I have been told that I have a bad first impression the first time people see me, many people say I look mean and with a bad attitude. However, I do not have an attitude when people are friendly or speak me. New research says that it is far easier to lose a good reputation, then to gain one. Which is true, but you would never know how is the other person until you speak to them. You cannot judge a person by the way they look, speak or trees. For example, a couple of years back on my first day of school, in the United States, people would judge me because, they thought I knew English, and when they would speak to me, I would put my head down and not say anything, months later I learned English and knew how to have a conversation with them; Not long a long, I had a person come to me and say; I did not tank you spoke English, because I remember back in 6th grade, you would not talk. He changed the way he thought of me when I started having a conversation with him. Perhaps, You can always change you first impression. First impressions are clearly not the best ones, but we can always make a choice on whether change them or not. I have experienced many first impressions. However, I have always told myself that my reputation does not depend on how others see or think of me, depends on how I see myself. Only ourselves have the choice to change our first impression.
