Make sure you have your seat belts. That is the people from the air plain making sure everyone is safe because wee are going strait to Argentina. Safety is the most important thing because if wee don't have safety wee not getting to Argentina. Argentina is the place I want to visit because it has one of the best player in the world. I will love to visit Argentina because they have good soccer players and l want to see them, have something from them like a signature or a picture with them. When I get their I'm going to see the nearby place to eat because I want to taste the flavor of the Argentina food because they have good food, but I can't name them they have a wear name. However after that I want to go and visit the soccer field take some pictures were the famous player play. And finally l will pay for a hotel to sleep because I'm going to be tiredly for all the amazing thing that I did all day long. I don't know, but I would like to know if it is true that Argentina has good money.?
