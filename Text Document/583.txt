Albert Einstein once said imagination is more important than knowledge. I have three reasons why I support his statement. My fist reason is if man haven't imagined light would Thomas Edison create the light bulb? Second, is because imagination gives hope. Hope for one day to cure cancer, hope to stop world hunger, hope to have world peace. Phones, laptops, microwaves, how do you think we got their? It's because people imagined things other people thought wasn't possible. Because they didn't have the knowledge about it. Let's take the light bulb for example. People in those days used candles, and believe me as a kid whose been in the countryside, it's not the same. Thomas Edison imagined if he can create light, and he did it. Now his work led to lots of good every day things. Like TV, microwave, electronic toothbrush, laptops and so on. I had a friend, and her dad was sick. He had cancer, and they couldn't afford the medicine. Her mom was a housewife, so she didn't have a job. If it was me in that scenario I would have give up and accepted my dads fate. Unlike me my friend started working at McDonald. Getting paid 15 dollars an hour. She worked 4 hours on the week days and 6 hours on weekends. She made enough money to pay for her dads medicine and buy food for the house. Even tho she had to work, her grades where better than mine, and every time she felt down she starts imagining what she would do with her dad after he gets better, and that gave her hope. Hope to work even harder.2 month later it was time for her dads' surgery, but she didn't have enough money for the surgery. That's when the entire neighborhood decided to help her. After that her dad got his surgery and got better. Now she is in high school, working hard for a scholarship. In conclusion, imagination is what makes us move forward. I don't know about you, but I can't imagine life without creativity, hope, and joy. Because that's what would happen if we didn't imagine the future
