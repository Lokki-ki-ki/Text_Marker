I agree that loser can try to achieve success there are many types of loser who try and get success in around the world like in school some student can't pass the sol and some student pass quick in one time, but the loser who fail the sol first time he going to try to achieve and pass in second time because every old man say never give up do it whit hard work, and do with your heart then the success will come to you easily. Next, to be honest a lot of success can harm you because they can'control them self and invest their money anywhere like in casino in Alcohol, Druges, and all that can harm your feature like your kids going to be had so much money he will get everything what he needs sport Car, nice House, so he will think i don't have to do anything he does'NT have the stress on his mind to do something in life in small age he will smoke Migrate and Drink Alcohol. Then, if you control your success in right position your feature going to be amazing like Obama he is the President of United States of America he has a so much power in his hand to do anything, but the most important thing is he know how to use that power he has big colt role on his success he also has a lot of money, but he doesn't have any bad habit like Drug or something he also made his feature good, and he says to his two daughter he says to them go and find work for your self you guys can dependent on me you have to stand on your legs and show the world what you can do every. On the other hand, big example of the president of India first he was on the street he's selling tea, and he does not have enough money to study, but luck is most important in our life his luck Chang, and he is the president of India he did so much strangle and hard work in his life and get success, but he doesn't have any control eon his success and he invests money on useless things and people in India say he is not a good for India people hat him he is higher the cost of full, food,electricity, rent and more, and if he had the control eon his success India was going to be like America. Finilly, I campier both American and Indian president and see the success and failure power in my opinion the United States of America have the success control power that's why people like to love there, and they also like there president, and India does not have success power that's why people dose'NT like president, and they don't want to love their, so this is the power of success if you use carefully you are good but if you don't, you die.
