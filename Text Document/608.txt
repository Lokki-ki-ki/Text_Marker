According to former British prime minister, Wilson Churchill, he said," success is consisted of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm". Which indicates that being general successful is formed by multiple mistakes and, over and over failures and also being passionate to what we want to achieve. In my opinion, I am totally agreed to his wisdom of words by Wilson, Churchill, because there are many persons in general that could show that the failures is part of success without loss of love to what we do. For instants, A famous and big star NBA and MVP basketball player Micheal, Jordan once said that, the process of being successful is an action of reputation of practice including failures. This clearly indicates, before Micheal became a successful basketball player star, he receives and faced hardship competing and playing basketball in several years of his career in NBA. In addition, According to Micheal's father, he said, Micheal fails so many times to his dream career such as: physically, emotionally and, mentally. However, he didn't stop chasing his dreams because, I know and, he knows how much he loves playing basketball. These also shows, Micheal obtained his successfulness because, he is basketball enthusiast.
