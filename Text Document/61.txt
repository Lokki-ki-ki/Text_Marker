The school use cell phones in the classroom for education purposes it's because they want the student learn the other way can, but they had to be doing work and the same time kids start thinking other way to use cell phones in life. Theacher they're thinking the best opportunity to explain in own life that way we can use the cell phones appropriate in the future. Because some teacher they worry about it are future and how we can go. Some teacher try to give anything to work on paper or looking for new, event, and search anything but the class. They making to take some examen online and quiz on the cell phone used app to get on the quiz. When we're talking about schools, some they are in lawful of the school to us cell phones in classrooms. that's why some school they have own laws about cell phone. They are many school they had own rule, and they don't want the student use cell phones for any reason. They are many institutions or protein to help school how they can teach, and the student learn something new and how they can put on his life. Conclusion they are many ways you can teach student used the cell phone but you most to explain why? The school is important to teach student how they use own cell phone. I hear many teachers tell the people. What other thing you can do with you cell phone, but don't tell my calling I want to hear other thing like.? I know some people don't answer the question.?they many things can help people and student to can see on the phone they can do to be a better person, but they don't lose time doing they't, and they are most on the computer, or they take class and read book all the time. Yeah is good people read all the time, but they had to explore the world too on the other side like used new technology.
