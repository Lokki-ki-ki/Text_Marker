Ralph Waldo Emerson"To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment." I agree with Emerson's statement about individuality because each person is a world, and we have to do our things separate and does how we learn about life doing our on things' life is not easy as how we think when we are with our parent's, but you have to be older not young, so we can decide to do our own things. We have to work for what we want nothing in this life is easy, All the people need to take a decision in life but first we need to go to school and then graduated and look for a job and like that we are going to know more about life and make decision and knowing more about life, but we always need the endorsement of our parent's.
