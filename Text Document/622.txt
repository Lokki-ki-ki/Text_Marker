What Thomas Jefferson wrote to determine never to be idle it is wonderful how much may be done if we're always doing may mean something to him being his opinion from what he is saving may be true every one can accomplish something for what they have done like for instance to help others or to finish something import. My opinion to what he is saving might mean that everyone has their own did dent way by accomplishing something on their paste some people maybe slow on what they do and get thing done that way and for some other people maybe the opposite they would know what they are doing and get thing done faster than otherwise we do something and getting it done we do accomplished things way faster the more we finish something the greater feeling we get in with ourselves like being proud. But no that may not be true accomplishing something may be hand for some other people. People that get thing done are usually the people that want to succeed on their work, without slaking off. They would always stay on task and accomplished with what they got to do. For those people that don't accomplish something on time usually maybe really busy with many things and things and not getting the other things finished. For what it is always a good thing by accoplishisomething more, because we get things done and not having ton worried about anything else.
