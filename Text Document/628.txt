Most student enjoy summer vacation, but some educators feel that the summer break is too long and that student does not retain information as easily when they return in the fall. Most of the student have reason that is too much break during summer break, but I disagree with the idea of change the schedule of vacation time. Could be during summer break the student forget some information of school, but all student wait for summer because much student like to travel to their country during vacation time, or some student only can see their family during summer break and their like to pass time with them, I guess is better time to take vacation in summer. Also, the eductors need to think about the thing they can do during summer break because during winter the weather is awful and also is too much snow and is too cool for to go outside. Another reason that why is bad idea to get break during winter is because in winter the job is slow, and the center recreational are close like the pool, beach, park, and the fair. I think 3-4 week break during summer is a little be of time to have fun with the family, and enjoy their vacation I don't see the main point of the change because if they change the longer break for winter it takes the same time because they also want that student take a week break during spring and falls; Is more complicated if they change the schedule.Therefore, is a bad idea to change because it should be the same way it doesn't matter what time or what station is the break it should be the same way, because if they do in winter they're going to forget information, either is not good idea because the student cant enjoy their break for the weather. In conclusion I am disagree with the idea and is better during summer break, because could be the same time that the student loose.
