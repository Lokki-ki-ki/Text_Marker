Working in group would be much better, because you will be able to get more help by the other people, like how people in my country say "2 brain's think more than one". If you work by yourself it will be hard because you would have to do a lot of work by yourself, like if the teacher say's that all the student's will choose to work with someone or by yourself, because they would make a poster, and it has to have drawing, colored, and write some stuff about it, for the one who is doing it alone it would be hard, and for the one that are working in group can meet in any of their houses, while someone is doing the writing the other one would be doing the drawing and colored, so it would be easy for them to do it. There area lot of people that think that working by themselves would be more easily because they would not have to worry about to meet somewhere with your partner, or getting worry about that your partner doesn't do the right thing on the poster(or not did it). Doing it by yourself would take a lot more of time, but you will do it the way you would like. Working in groups would be better than doing it by yourself, if you are in a sport you would not like to work by yourself, because you will need the help from your teammates so the team can win, if you do it by yourself the team would not be able to win because you are not working together, the whole other team will try to get the ball away from you and your teammates will get mad at you because you didn't pass the ball on time, and you lose it.
