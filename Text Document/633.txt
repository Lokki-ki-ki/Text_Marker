Do we choose our own character traits? As the British naturalist and political John Lubbock wrote, "Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it." I certainly agree that everyone is capable of choosing their own character trait, they are independent enough to have control over themselves', they're capable to choose in what type of environment they want to be in, or how to react to bad or good circumstances, at the end of the day we all have the freedom to choose who, and what we want to be. Jonh Lubbock wrote, "Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it.' everyone has the completely control over themselves, no matter how bad the circumstances may be or how tough a problem is, everyone will always be allowed to choose either to smile or cry, to be positive or negative for example;My grandma, she's a 78 years old lady that have worked her entire life, she's a very independent woman who always says, "If I don't do it, no one can make it as good as I can." Always with a positive attitude, never sitting down, because she says that sitting down is a waste of time, and she has always been so energetic, until one day that sadly she had a really strong stroke in the middle of her brain that made her lose movement on half of her body, and her voice, her doctor told us that she was going to stay in a wheelchair for the rest of her life, it was hard to see someone so positive and with so much energy, in a wheelchair for the rest of her life, everyone was really shock and depressed about it including my mom, but even though my grandma knew what was going on her positive attitude never change, she took over the circumstances, and she never gave up on herself she decided to be "positive", even though it was a rough time in life, this example helped me to see that everyone have their own control, or they can choose who they want to be in the hard or easy times. Everyone can have the freedom to choose the environment around them, how they want to live, with whom they want to leave, people have the ability to understand when there are toxic people around them, to understand how much an environment can change the way they act, to understand that they can change the negative environment into a positive environment, everything in your character depends on your on person, yes the environment that is around you can affect a lot on your character, affects on what you do in a daily basis, but at the end of the day it always depends on you, who you want to be, who the people around you should make you feel, and how positive or negative it should be. Having a reaction with other people around you can show them what your character is, it can show people your weakest part, and can show them how dangerous or calm you can be, reactions are a huge part of our characters either if we have the control of them or not, how we react and how we respond depends on us, for a lot of people having their own character it's really hard, because of their negative or positive mood, sometimes we want to be or act like other people that we see at school, but that's like stealing their characters, at least but not last everyone has the freedom to choose what their character traits are or can be. In conclusion everyone is free to choose what they character should be, no matter if they are going through a rough time or have the whole word against hem, they will always have the chance of trying to be someone else character or build their own, but it will always be what they choose their character traits to be.
