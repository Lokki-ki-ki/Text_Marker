I disagree with this statement because people can show the appositive to the attitude they showed before. And they can show no a good way at the first time for some good reasons; maybe they are shy, or have had bad experiences with a good group of people. Sometimes the people can think a person who saw for the first time and saw he or she needed help and the person didn't help is because the person didn't want to help but is because the person is no extrovert and think is no a good idea to ask. Sometimes a person says "Hi" with a good tone to a person who saw for the first time and the person response with no a good tone and the happens the same thing with other person, then the person now is kind like before, and when see other person doubt if say "Hi" with a good tone, and when they are meeting each other the other person realize the person was so kind before.;
