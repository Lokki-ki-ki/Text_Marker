First impressions are very important but could they be changed?. Yes, yes they could be changed because first impressions don't justify who you are as a person and some people don't act the same when you first meet them. However, some people are really judgmental about first impressions and could block off any type of relationship they had with you being job related, maybe girlfriend or boyfriend, and friends. First impressions are serious which drives a lot of people insane. Because they don't know how the people are going to react to them but, it's okay that doesn't define who you are as a person. A great tip of advice is being able to read a room that means how people are acting in certain time and place. Like what's the vibe and mood if you should be more relaxed, goofy, serious etc. If you can read a room first impressions will become a lot easier because you will know how to act. But that's not the only way to have a good first impression most people don't act the same say on the first date, its probably going to be awkward and silent because you don't know how to act verses seeing someone for the 5th time. You know what to say, you know how to have an okay conversation. But dates aren't the only situations that first impressions fall into. Jobs, jobs are the biggest make or break for first impressions from experience you can't be nervous and just be real you don't have to act differently. If your job takes you for what you have then it's a great job.However, first impressions are very, very judgmental. Some people take first impressions over anything because it's the first glimpse they have of you and how you act as a person. And if they don't like you won't give you a job or another date depending on the situation. And there is nothing you can do about it. Not even getting the chance to change the first impression. So is it hard to change a first impression yes, but it's not impossible.
