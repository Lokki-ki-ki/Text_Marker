Imagine a life where people think the same and look the same, it is like a world without stain, to some people will sound perfect, but life is attempt to do mistakes and learn from it, where people can't compare themselves, where you can accept that in some cases, there are better people than you or worst than you, life is like that, but the greater accomplishment is to be different from others. First, if people in the world including you are the same, the world will get bored for example; when you're working an factory that do the same thing every day, after a long time working there, you are going to get bored. The better way to do is doing something different every day, same with people if you and the people stay the same nothing is going to distinguish you, but since you born you came with your own thoughts and qualities, for those reasons you have tried and work for yourself. Secondly, working by yourself and focus about you, and your own goals will help you to get your goals very quickly, because if you do the same thing that the people is doing, you will stay the same as them and lose interest about what are you doing and be an ordinary person. We have a talent to discover, but you have to work individual to reach it, no one is going to do it for you. Third and last reason doing something that everybody is afraid to do it, is a way to show that you are different, no matter what people said. In the beginning they are going to tell you a lot of things, so you can stop it, but when you reached they are going to be astonishing. In conclusion; the best way to live, is trying to make you something else, so people can distinguish you from others, where you can improve your self, and try to be different from others. You will enjoy your life and have a better future, so people should try to be an individual person to have a better future and be successfully in life.
