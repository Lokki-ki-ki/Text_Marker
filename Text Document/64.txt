I believed that what you yourself choose to make it because a lot people have different choices in the life some people have different influence of what they believed on their own choices and ability for example like lifestyle and what they enjoyed doing to do also what they believed and what's right or wrong, who they hang out with. I learned it in different situation from experiencing with my friends like some they change there believes and some have different lifestyle of living some parents disprove of them the way of living and some are disappointing what they choose to do in life. Furthermore, I have a friend that there parents are religious they don't agree with his lifestyle but still respects his choices in life. Furthermore, I used to having out with my friend in house where I'm met his parents they told me there stories about how education was so important to them how they got more jobs from it but the other side of there family like his uncle didn't graduated from collage but still came successful. Furthermore, I have other example told my parents my sister like going to school and told them i didn't have an interest in going to school I sometimes thought about not going to collage.Also, I believed what you yourself to choose to make it because a lot people have different choices in life and history some depending places where you live of come from for example like in eastern European Bosnia and Hergionvian some people are Catholic, Orthdox and some are Muslim they grew up having lifestyle of living and also in the U.S. some people don't use modern stuff and us old fashion for example the Amish and also speak German different dialect and English.I believed people have the right to choose they way want to live or do with their choices they make and become successful. I think people have different mind set of life finding out who they are what's there goal in life.I believed there different goal and ability of doing it and the passion.I believed a lot people can anything in life that is something positive bring joy and get a lot of success and get noticed. Also for the people that do negative things i believed they should get a second chance to do it no one is perfect I think failure is the mother of success people should have a positive mind what there going to do.
