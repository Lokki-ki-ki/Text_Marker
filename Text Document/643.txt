Art classes are important for some people but not all students want to take this class they could be doing something that they would like to do, such sports, science and many other classes. Students do not see art as a big deal this day's, they do not see a lot of outcomes from art classes, is too hard to have a carrier coming from art, really hard to be successful in the art market, art can be that important in the students' life. Do something cool or nice to do it's the best thing, if the person do not like the class, will be a big chance of the student try to skip class, walking around the school wasting time, a time that they could be using to do something that they would like to do, problems with teachers can happen if they do not agree to do the work in class. This can affect the student in so many ways, and nobody wants to see a student not happy with what he is doing at school, this just do not take the student time but also the teacher's time to teach who wants to learn something in the class. Those are real problems that happens in every school, so to avoid these problems I think art class should be elective.
