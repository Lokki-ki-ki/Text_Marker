On my Opinion I think is a good way to the student that they can take classes on online or on video chat is a good way to do it, because some students sometimes some then they live so far of the school so they don't have other way to educate they self and I think is a good communication to learn. Is a good benefit because is an easy way to do it, easy and fast and is good too because sometimes some days is snowing and when is snowing all school are closed. And they close the school because the students can not transportable to the like that because the streets are freeze and really complicate to transport to the school. If I have to take classes on online or video chat I will because easier for me and is not difficult to learn on online or video chat. And because I can have more free time I can do more things and I can have a job. And think too for some student is not good because they don't have the opportunity to have a computer t do they classes online or they don't have internet is difficult for them. Is a good option online classes but not for all students some of them are benefit and some of them dot. Only classes are a good reason to use because is a good way to communicate in a long distance, but Free online schools, have to be free all schools online for all students they don't have to pay nothing. The time if they take online classes they go not miss anything because they can star when they want. On my opinion is a good way to do it.
