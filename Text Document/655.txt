I planned my paper before writing it. Because if you planned your paper before writing it is more easy, so you can be ready to written any important information about anything that the teacher tell you to written about. I can be something that can help you to make your grades better because if you don't planned your paper can cause you a lot of problems because when is your turn comes to written. You are not going to be ready, so the teacher is going to look at you, and she will be upset with you for example. If I don't planned my paper in time I can get in travel too because i am not doing what the teacher tell me to do so that's why you have to prepared in time before you get in travel because you are the one who is loosened point's not the teacher because she is telling you what you have to do. But if you decide not to follow the rules is going to be a problem. One more thing is you planned your paper on time you are doing great because planned your paper before writing it is something good the teacher is going to be happy in you will get better grades. Another example of planned your paper before writing is the information you have to written is really important you don't Anna miss the information so that's why you have to be prepared in be ready for what is going to come. I checked my paper to be sure that my message will be clear to my reader, is really important to checked what you're writing or what are you going to do because if a written a paragraph an if didn't write correctly an i handed to my reader and his start reading it his going to tell me what I did wrong, so you have make sure checked your paper with a message before you handed to the reader or to you parents etc.
