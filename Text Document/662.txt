Former BirtishPrime Minister Winston Churchill Once Said That "Success Consists Of Going From Failure To Failure Without Loss Of Enthusiasm". In my opinion, the former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill was right about his statement, saying that ''success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. Because in life, before you achieve any of your dreams or goals, you've to pass through some difficulties. Some people may disagree with Winston Churchill saying because they've not experience any hardship, or any failure in life before. The reason is that they were born with silver or gold spoon in their mouth. They don't even know how hard ship is or looks like. Those people have no idea how it feels to be a failure, or a loser, or to even loss enthusiasm in life. Even though, some of them are rich today, but they when through a lot of difficulties, disappointments, and they even lost hope in themselves to the point that they couldn't believe that they will make it in life because of the struggle or hard ship they when through. In addition, failure plays an important role in our pursuit of success. The reason I'm saying this is that if you don't have any experience of failure or without the loss of enthusiasm, you won't know the importance of that wealth you have or your parents has. For example, my mother once told me her story that when she was in Africa in my country Liberia, she when through a lot of difficulties, disappointments, and hard ship during the civil war and after the civil war. According to my mother, she said things was really hard on her, and she said that she had no one to helped her to the point that she used to asked people in the community for food to eat just so she and my oldest sister can be able to salvaged from hunger. In summary, the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill was right about his statement that says "success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm''.
