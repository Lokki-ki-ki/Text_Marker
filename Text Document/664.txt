Some schools have an after school homework club where students and teachers help other students with homework. I think that a homework club would be beneficial to students because it could help with grades, it is not mandatory, and could help with teaching skills. Homework is a staple of school an student hate it, so why not get some help with it. Most students forget about homework and get a bad grade because of it. Why not get help with homework and remember any other home works you have to do. With a few good homework grades they could pass their classes. Students all have different ways of thinking and learning, and why should their learning to be all the same. If every student had to go and take part in this club the more introverted students would be more tired out. If the students are tired out they are not going to learn anything and that effects them in a bad way, but the homework club is not mandatory that is why it is not a class that we have to go to every other day. Some students have big dreams, but don't know how to get to them. If someone wants to be an anthropologist, the study of humans, they will need to be smart and brave enough to publish their findings. A homework club can help make trusted bonds and encourage people to talk and speak up for themselves. So many schools have a homework club but not many people know about it and are failing because of it. I think that a homework club would be beneficial to students because it could help with grades, it is not mandatory, and could help with teaching skills. I hope that this essay will have you consider putting your child in a homework club.
