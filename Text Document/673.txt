I think I agree because some people were seeking success and some other people were doing the same, but they were doing their best to reach what they asked for. People didn't want to lose what they needed because they have to keep doing what they are doing to reach that goal that they always think of. Assuming like you want to be something that you like to be you have keep trying until you get to it because is like you want to have it to your own self. People don't like to fail because they don't want to fail, they work hard to achieve the goal. Winston Churchill was telling people that when you fail to do something people will get it and stand up for it. Even though people already achieve their goal, they to keep going at it. Winston Churchill was maybe told the people about how important to take a role that are engaged to success. People felt inspired about his quote because makes think that people were strong about the feeling that they have to succeed into it. People believed that if they succeed through it, they would achieve it. I conclude that if people want to succeed into what they are in, or already done, they still need keep trying and push themselves to achieve that goal.
