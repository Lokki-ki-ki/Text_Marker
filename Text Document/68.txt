I think that the online or video conferencing would not benefit high school student because they many pros and con. Pros student can work on their own student can work on home cannot all students have an access to the internet student cannot understand the assessment it make it not English speaker to understand student cannot benefit for attend classes from house. Because take classes from home cannot improve the student educated. In the school class student are allow to work with group and work with teacher. Home school can cause distraction, worries. For Example when you're work or take exam and your family member call you to do something for her. In school, they taught you many things to learn. Online classes and school classes have similarity and different thing in common First different between these two classes is that online classes are classes that you take home why school classes are classes that you take in school. The second different between these two classes is that in online class you don't learn lots of things. But in school classes you learn of thing. These is the similarity between two classes. The first similarity between two class is that both classes are required the second similarity between two class is that both classes are teaches by teacher
