I think working with a group of person it will be perfect, because the time going faster, and also that fell more good working with a group, and because we can helping of each other, and I think we can make more friends when you work with a group, what happened when you work alone you can be bored really faster or something like that, and you going super slow and you don't not what to do to make the time going super faster, you can't talk with not body and finished it faster, and you fell the time going slow and you don't know what to do to make the time going faster, and for example when you are working with a group of people you fell good, because when you don't know something they can helping you with the ting that you don't know, and that's how you can make an idea of how to do it new time, and also if you work like that you can finish it super faster, lest support that I'm working with a group of 4 person each one have to do one part of the project that we doing it and explain tone part of the project but if one of us forget something we can help explain it, what happened if I work by my self on the presentation I have to reading and explain everything not body can help me with the presentation or when I don't understand something, a presentation have to be with a lot of answer and explain much, that's why I think is better work with a group of people.
