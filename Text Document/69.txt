If your having so much trouble in a problem you have just ask an adult or some friends. It would be good to have more than one person. Because a friend could be fake and give bad advise like drink alcohol to feel better or cut your self because you are depressed. Nothing of that is good so when a good friend comes to tell you advise they tell you good things. Another thing is that maybe someone could be lien to you about something. And some people try to help but sometimes they make it the worst by giving you bade dives. Like I said earlier someone might be lien to you like for example he/she might say leave the house because your parents cause the problem. So you have to detect that or else you will get in serious problems. So i f you know that there is a fake friend trying to tell you lies say ok and leave. Another thing I said is that they probably give you the best advise. What I mean about that is that they try to help you, but they only make it worst like for example: your bf (boyfriend) breaks up with you, and you cry for hours, and he says ask him to be your bf again you will be embarked in front of everyone the last point I wanted to talk about is that more than one person is good to give you advice because some of them can not be helpful some of them can be liars and some of them can be fake advise
