Dear Generic_Name, Would you rather work with friends who are going to keep you distracted from off-topic conversations ? In my opinion, it would be better to work alone so that you can focus on your work. In my science class, we always get the opportunity to work with partners. But I rather work alone and if I need help or don't understand something I can always ask my teacher. If you work alone you have a better chance of learning more and passing your final exam. It's good to work with partners sometimes. Although, you have a better chance of passing your class. You also get the chance to get good skills. Like to not depend on anybody for help, to be a leader not a follower. Before my uncle passed away, he told me to never depend on nobody for help. You have to climb the steps by yourself to get to where you want to be. I want to own a mechanic shop by myself when I am older. Ill work on all the cars by myself with no employees. You can learn a lot of skills by working alone. Everybody has different opinions, some people say working with partners may be easier and helpful. But you have to think about all the distractions and trouble making kids. Letting other students do all the work and then copying and take credit for someone else work. I used to be one of those kids until I noticed I am never going to learn or get somewhere in my life if I keep letting people carry me over my steps. To conclude, working with partners may be easier, faster and exciting. Working alone is a men job, to not be a follower. To not let anybody else do their work or to carry them over your steps.
