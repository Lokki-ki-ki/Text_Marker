An enjoyable educational activity is when I was doing a science experiment woods building a volcano. It erupted we are all smiling because we didn't know it was going to work. We put soda inside the volcano and we shook it a little and then put Mentos it went high. We had to clean it up after there was a mess everywhere, but it was fun. As soon as everybody left I was taking to the teacher to ask her was I got. He told me that I got a B and I got mad because I got a B I was all like how, and he told me that there was soda everywhere. It was messy, and it had Mentos in it, and I was like please give me an A or can I at least remake it. He was like you can have one more chance to remake it I was all like thank you. It took me a while to make it and think what I can do so it won't spill anywhere. So I thought of putting a cone around the volcano put I was all like nah because what's the whole point of putting it if you can't see it. I got an idea I put a lighter in side and a put a special paint that blows up with just fire. It can not make a mess I don't have to clean the floor I think this is the best idea. I did it and i tried it out at my house, and it always blew up everywhere and I kept on thinking and thinking, but I had no idea Thought that it had too much paint and ii keep on putting it little by little. It kinda worked if I put a little in a bottle and light it like that but then I had an idea that if a put newspaper under it and let it burn it will help it, and it did and then I kept putting more and more newspaper it took like 16 news of paper and my brother helped me do it is was hard because i didn't know which way to put it. I got it all finished, and I took it to school. It was my turn I represented the volcano I lit it on fire and the whole volcano fell, and I was mad. After school the teacher called me and told me.''you did a great job, but it failed but guess what you get an A for at least trying'' I was so happy I didn't believe it I did it.
