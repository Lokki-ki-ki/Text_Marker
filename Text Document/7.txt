I think it's a good idea for the students to commit to a career at a young age. In addiction, the students are expected to identify a career they want and use the best for them. So the students can study in high school and select to guide them to career in specific they want. Fisrt, In high school all the students have differs dream on the world. Some students dream to be a Doctor, architecture, teacher, and nurse, etc. Is a good opportunity to have a good education and a make a good person and helpful. Then, the students can have a better life and good jobs. Sometimes the students in young age stead to think about what career is better for them. Others think what career is useful to make a good money and have a better class social. But all the students think different the others, and we have to respect they decision about they future. Secondly, In my opinion is good to think or dream in bigger. In my position my family do not have all lot of money to go to the university and pay for it. For example, some of my friends are a good Doctor and arquicteture, but the thing is when they want to be a good person a get better futures on their lives. Usually, when we think about it, but is so difficult to do it. Thirt, students in the school have special classes to go with a career. All the people have the opportunity to think about, which want to study and where they go too. But some students can't go to study the career they want, because some of them have to work and pay bill in their house. Usually some of them have everything in the house and the only thing they have to do is study and make sure they work to complete all the school and can go to study that set. In conclusion, is a good idea to know what you want to study in young age. Also, to be responsible all the things and have a great time of the life to think what is make you happy when you grew up. One day a want to be doctor of the animals. That will be make me happy.
