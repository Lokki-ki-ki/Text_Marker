Studies have shown that one way to improve student achievement is to start an after school homework club. Teachers and Students volunteer to meet those who either have difficulty in certain subjects or who want to finish their homework early. My opinion is that I find it a good idea to have a homework club, because when I was in 4th grade I went to a homework club and what I did there was of course work on homework but if you finished early you could finish work from later on that day or on things that you could do on the next day and I would always remember I would be ahead on every paper she assigned to the class because I already completed it! When I didn't do homework club I would sometimes miss fun Friday because during fun Friday in order to play you must have all your work done and be caught up. But when I joined homework club I haven't missed one fun Friday game! In conclusion, I suggestion having a homework club, it helps with grades and getting ahead in class! It's also very fun
