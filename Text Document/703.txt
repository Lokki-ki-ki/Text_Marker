Teachers and students volunteer to meet with those who have difficulty in certain subjects. By having an after school homework club. Reasons for an after school homework club? An after school homework club would be nice to have because they get better grades, they could study more, and they could understand the subject butteriest of all, they get better grades by helping each other on their homework, and they can socialize to know more people, make new friends. Plus they can make up stuff they haven't done at all and have a zero in their grade. It also benefits in all ways, you could get straight As by just taking 1-3 hours extra hours of your day and putting the work into it. If you don't work at all you could consider trying harder to pass the class. Next, they could study more. Studying more could be a benefit because better test grades, better quiz grades, etc. Also, they could get ahead on their classes by doing extra homework and normal work. If you never study you could start by considering joining this club. It could be loads of fun if you make it fun. Therefore, they could understand the subject better by getting someone to help them. Doing loads of extra work to get your grade up and understand it better. They could help each other out and could achieve their goal of getting to understand the difficult subject. Finally, those are the reasons why the idea would be a benefit for everyone. It could help everyone out in every way. That's why I consider this idea to be true and make the club available for everyone. Also, there's a ton more benefits that could help too.
