Conserving energy and resources, this is what the most part of the society is worried about, some business are even adopting a four-day work week, each day consisting of ten hours; but should schools apply this model by extending the school day two hours? Well, I believe that schools should adopt this model because: It gives students a longer weekend to vacation, or simply to their favorite activities, second reason would be learning part, students will have a longer period of time for each class, which means they can learn faster, or memorize it easier; then we have the most important; the resources and energy saving. Almost every student loves to have a logger weekend, one example could be my neighbor Generic_Name; he loves to go camping on weekends, sometimes he tells me, he wishes to have a longer weekend, that would allow him to go even further or simply to stay logger at the same place, I am pretty sure that the three days weekend would make him happy, others may also be thankful, because they will have more time to do their homework or just to study. Me, as an example, I rather to stays at home and study; sometimes, I feel like the weekend went off a lot faster than the usually. The second reason, which is so important for students, I believe it is; the longer classes that we will have, this will make a great impact on the grades of the students, longer classes will make us learn quicker, Generic_Name my brother is one of those student that forget some important things about any class, I always tell him, "Generic_Name study, do your homework," and he has already forgotten what the homework was about, I believe Generic_Name will get better and remember the homework with the logger period of classes; also in my class of science, sometimes the whole class is experimenting with some word liquids, and we are still mixing when, the bell rings, my teacher, Generic_Name, says, "it would be grateful, if we would have more time, so we would be able to finish the experiments," and of course! The entire class agree with what he says. Some people might say that students would forget something's during weekend, however the four-day school week will help to conserve energy and resources; there is a massive wave of air solution in this world, and one of the biggest is fossil fuel, millions of kids are dropped to school by their parents, if we start coming to school a day less; it would case a great impact over the solution, it could reduce solution a lot, also the government will save a lot of money in terms of food sources, every day, schools give tons of food just for students, a non-classes Friday could help to save that many resources. As a conclusion, I believe schools should adopt this four-day school week because; it will make students to enjoy the new schedule, the three-days weekend, this will give more time to do our favorite activities or to study. It will also give us longer classes, where we could have bigger activities without being worry about the time, at least not as much as before, but it will be enough, and my last one which I believe the most important, society will have less air solution, and also the government will save a lot of money if we get the four-day school.
