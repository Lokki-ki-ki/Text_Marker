Have you ever stop and think what made the person that you are right now? I believe that there are much greater ways than just being a good person, because being a good person can be bad and having more possibilities is more beneficial than just having although many people think that your own influence can be the best way, I believe there are better ways to teach people the right path. My mom mother never yelled at me before, she is always nice with, because every time she starts to even think about, she remembers her father how she was always mean with her, as much as she wanted to be hated him she told to herself to never treat people the way her father did, So even if my her father wasn't a good Role Model, she was still able to get better as a person. When I was younger my Brother and I would play video games, but I always had to sleep early than him because I was the youngest one. I never wanted to sleep, but Brother always told me that: "if you don't sleep you won't be able to talk and see anymore". He did lie to me, but it was for my own good. In conclusion, Being just a good isn't the only thing that matters, you also need motivation and be capable of doing anything that you want to do, even if the adults are aggressive and evil.
