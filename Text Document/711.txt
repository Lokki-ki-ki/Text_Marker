Do we pick our own character traits? Can it be picked by the type of influences that is beyond our control? If so then What kind of traits would we have? How are the trails we choose is the right traits for us? Most people say the type of traits a person can have defined who are as a person, and saying that is sure because the kind of trait you would have or choices can define your character. Like for instances let's say you are a very working person your so dedicated to your work that is a trait of dedication or when a person is so nice to you that shows kindness another trait. Even maybe a person who likes to read that would be a bookworm this is also a trait. Everybody has a trait that they choose. We choose our owns traits because we think, or we know that's the kind of traits we want to have. I am a person who loves to read books, loves food, kind to others, and who can be lazy at most time. A guy name John Lubbock Said" Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it." I'm choosing these traits to be myself and myself only. The kind of traits I have is kindness, laziness, bookworm, foodie, and family Orient all of this trait are the traits i choices because it makes the person I am today. Being family Orient, I've always loved being around my family because it's giving this joy and happiness just to be around them, plus they make me feel so safe and sound when I'm with my family, all of my traits make up whom I am. Others think it's the opposite because your trait can be chosen by the type influences but I have to disagree on that because people in this world choice the kind of traits they want to have. It doesn't matter on many traits you might have they can still define who you are. Or weather if they are good traits or bad traits they can still define who you are, becuase you are your own person.
