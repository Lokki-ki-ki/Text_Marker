Year-round schools have more break over the year, you may have more break during the year, but you will have less vacation time over the summer, it's going to shows that year-round schools has more stress, less vacation time and less money make over the summer. The first issue about year-round schools is more stress, the main thing students stress about is what clothes should they wear to school everyday it makes students to buy more clothes even when they have a lot of clothes because some students want to look better than everyone else in school by not wearing the same clothes every day to school. Students are not the only people who stress teachers will stress about what lesson should they teach, and they will a lot of assignment to grade. The second issue about year-round schools is less vacation time, students will have 3 to 4-week vacation over the summer, so student won't have as much vacation time as they would like to have because 3 to 4-week vacation is not a lot of time for student to go to another country for long time. Parents will be affected by this too because some responsible parents can't leave their kids and go to another country alone. The third issue about year-round schools is less money make, student can't work over the summer because they don't have the time, one month is not a long period of time to work you can still make some money, but you can's make as much money as you could make in 3 months not only the students would make less money government will too they would buy for the electricity and water and other stuff. Some may say you will have more breaks over the year, but you will not have as much vacation time over the summer. Some other may say you will not forget anything you learned if you have short break time, but learning every day without any long breaks will make you a lot of stress.
