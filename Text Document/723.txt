Would you like your child go to the college or work force early ? Why not ? Some schools offer ways to a student to be prepared and go into their goals. However, most of the students think that they are ready to reach their goals early instead of going 4 years high school because it makes more complex for a student who wants to finish high school and be prepared for the future. I consider saying, there are ways for them to get ready because students get jobs, start college early and get experience or success that can makes them a professional as quickly as they can. For instance, start college early, the student could learn more about their careers and get some ideas for what they look for. Other reason is the students get jobs easily, makes them work for the future for not being the guy who works in restaurants and other stuffs with a low income. Lastly, Be success in your life, that's why parents are so proud of their children's and taking care for a good paternally, I conclude saying that going 3 years high school is going be easiest to a student because they could learn more, get more experience and be successful in their daily life, as much as they can, student provide more percentage of intelligence that can be more well known at a short period
