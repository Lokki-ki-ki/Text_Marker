Some high school districts offer programs that allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years. I think this is a bad Idea because students should be required to be in school eight hours every day. Allowing these students to take online courses they lack teaching and instructions in a classroom, evening school is a poor idea, and elective courses should be required to boost their GPA. Letting students have these options they might not enjoy school as they should. In other words, I think students should and must be placed in a classroom. Take an example physical education and health is a required course for graduation. However, how can you allow a student to take a course like that online and expect he or she to learn. I am not saying it impossible; I think they should be taught. A course like this deserve to be in a gym somewhere, so students can interact with one another. Also, most students do not comprehend well through a screen and this might affect their way of learning. Also, I think evening school is a bad idea because students need that eight hour of sleep every night. Giving them these options it could lead to bigger problems. This could ruin he or she lifestyles because they have to be willing to get up at night to attend school. Absences could rise up because the students could be tired. When they have this option parents might not be able to take them to school if they live far and this could lead to safety issues. In conclusion, school districts should insist the traditional four years of high school. When they have an extra year, they could use it to boost their grades. Having elective courses could help the students dramatically. Most students tend to score low in one class then others. Letting students take elective courses it could boost their GPA. Students should be placed in a classroom with everybody else, and it would give them the opportunity learn and interact with each other.
