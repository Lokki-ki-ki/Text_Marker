Well the business that I want to visit is about hospital or pharmacy, and now I will try to convince to get the permission the manager of the business. Hello Sr, how are you? I hope that you are good, the reason why I am writing this letter is that I want to tell you or ask you or get the permission of you, if I can visit your business? Will I have some reason, why I want to visit your business :First I want to visit your business because am interest and I want to learn more of your business, because I want to work or have a career in my High School, probably may you ask why I am so interesting of your business, but the answer is this is because one day I was at my house playing soccer with my friends, and after we're done to play, my mom call me that was a emergency at my sister house, so I drove so fast that I can, when I was there, my sister had a heart attack, so we took her to the hospital, so after the thirty minute was nobody there who can attend us and the more time that we are standing more bad was my sister, so I was so angry with the hospital service, so we didn't want to continue wearing in the same hospital, so we went to another hospital that people said that is good hospital, but real was that there was the same thing, so my question was where are the doctors? Why nobody attends us? My sister is almost die after 30 minutes a doctor came to us to attend my sister, now my sister is good she has no problems with her heart, but when the doctor done to attend us, I asked him a question, I said why all the hospitals take to long for attending the people?and he said It's because we don't have much medicament to attend all people who enter sick or with serious problems also he said we don't have a good supply for attending the people who came very sick or almost dying, also we don't have many doctors in here, that why we are slow to attend the people. Well I was thinking about all people who die because in many hospitals don't attend them, but sometimes the people don't see the problems that happening in the hospitals, also many doctors don't get a pay, but they're still working because they see the needs the people have. Well I thought that maybe I can be a doctor who save life and help people who need it, that is why I am interested in this business or job. Second reason why I want to convince you to let me visit your business it's because I want to be a doctor, and learn how talk to sick people, and see what things you use to emergency, also I want to have a good adventure, also I wanna meat people to make new friends, my second point is a little be friendly, because in your business you have to make friends to help, or you can help them, like sometime we don't know something how do it, and may be your partner know how do it, that I am trying to explain is that if you make friends in job or business is to work problems that you don't know together, but if I make friends in the business it's to work, not for play during the work. Third reason I want to convince you is that many people or students want to explore certain occupations, I select this one because I want to learn about your business, how they work ? What type the rules is in your business, and how much you pay, what days we have free, all the normal things that we know that I have to learn, and also I want to know, how many days we work by week? . Fourth reason that I want to convince you manager is that your business is the best one and I want to learn everything of your business and know more every day and, you know what? When I was little my mom asked me that what I want to be when I have more age, or what are my dreams, every day my mom asked me the same questions and I said I want to be doctor the person who save life who help people and my mom told that if I put all the, also I tell you a short story, One day when I been five years old, I was in the school, and some bad people that they only like to play around and make people angry, one day I was studying and one of those kids started to annoying me and held me bad words, but he told me one thing that I never I will forget is that he told me that never I will have my dreams in my life, that I will looking for but never will be real, and I started to think about it and I was like sad because I thought that if that he told is real, if I never find my dream, what will happen to me ? What will be my life? And one day I was thinking in room I said I never give up, I will fight for my dreams, and nobody held me what to do, I just will follow my heart for everything, the point of this short story is that never give up if you have a dream looking for, don't let people who make you feel bad, don't listen negative people, just do it wherever you want to be or what want you that the people say when you die or something like that...five reason that I want to convince you that let me visit your business, is that many people have the chance to explore or visit a business, but some people just don't care, or they try but, if they can't make real, they give up, or they just move to another job or another dreams, but it's not how many times you go down, if no how many you get up, for example: I want to visit you business because that interest me and that why I am writing this and give you many examples of me and another people are because I want to learn if you give me the permission, I think that if let me visit your business, I will have more interest and I will have more emotion to be a doctor that is the work that interest and I will be honest with you all this that I wrote is for have your permission for I can visit your business and can know things that I want to know or see things that I never see before, also I want to tell you that, if you give me the opportunity to visit your business, and hope that you can let me visit your business if is like that, thank you for take a little of your time to read this, I hope that you have a great day.
