I agree with Albert Schweitzer, because he's a man with a lots of experience and influence. Let's say he is wrong, and my behavior is not the best way to influence other people, and maybe people only care about famous people and look up to them and get influenced by their behavior. Some people may agree with that statement, I just feel like it's not completely true. For example, let's say I was very unknown by a lots of people, and they see me saving a kitten of the road. Will people be influenced by my behavior? Even thought they don't know me, would they agree with my choice in saving the kitten? Or will they follow someone who's famous?. Albert Schweitzer said, "example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing." What he is saying is that no matter how famous or how infamous you are, everyone will follow someone's example no matter what the conditions may be, at the end someone will follow your behavior because they are influenced. This is why the quote that says "first impression is the last impression" because no boss is going to hire someone who's: show's up to work late or nor properly dressed or doesn't look serous to take the job. The conclusion of this statement is, that everyone is influenced by someone's example, and it doesn't matter who the person may even be. At the end I personally still agree with what Albert Schweitzer said, and I can not find a better statement or an argument that people may not know the right answer to. Everyone has to have some kinda example to look up to or look down on based on their behavior or actions.
