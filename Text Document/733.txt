To conserve energy and resources, Some businesses have adopted a four-day work week, With each day consisting of ten hours. My school should not follow this model or even consider extending the school day by two hours. At my school a full day of school consists of seven hours. Seven hours are more than enough, Now having it to be nine hours would be very overwhelming for everybody. Extending it two more hours is too much stress on the students, as well as the teachers. Also, most students have a part-time job after school and won't fit everyone's schedule. There is a lot to do after school and extending school two more hours would not help. It also would not only affect the students but the teachers too. Some teachers have a second job to go to after school, Some teachers have children to go take care of at home. Also, it is scientifically proven, That if students are in school for more than the seven hours they are usually in school, The students mind shut down. Once the mind shuts down the body does too. So whenever the teacher is teaching the students isn't picking up the information and isn't learning anything. The student isn't focusing and also tired. So it would not benefit the students much, by adding the two hours. It will most likely have the students failing, because they're not leaning or doing their work. No good benefit will come out of extending the school day, Only bad. The school board should leave it how it is. My school should not follow this model by extending the school day by two hours.
