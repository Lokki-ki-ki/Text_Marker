Does a positive attitude is the key for success in life? Do you think is True or False?First, Everyone has to have a positive attitude. Just imagine; a world without positive attitude, The world that we know will not be the same. Then, we'll have angry people everywhere. For example, there will not be sensible people at your Job, at the Mall, at the Store, even on your own home. The Virginia State University made a survey about if," Is positive attitude is the key to success in life" the 95% said Yes and the 5% said No. So do we need positive attitude to success in life, the answer is Yes. Back to My question "Do you think is True or False" is True, You need positive attitude if you want to success in life. I agree that we need positive attitude but not just in life, we need to success on everything. In conclusion everyone need a good attitude in life to succeed.
