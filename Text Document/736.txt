Imagination can be more important than knowledge because imagination might help us with our knowledge because imagining on creating something it might help us on the future. For example, you are imagining something that you want to make your knowledge is to try and never give up.First, knowledge might help us to in our lives, but it's important to imagine how we can live in our future with our skills of knowledge that we can have. In order to do something creative we have to have experience what were doing. In conclusion, I agree what Einstein said because when you imagine you see stuff that you don't realize and knowledge is about your skills and effort you can do on things.
