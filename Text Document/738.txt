Dear, PrincipalWhat you are doing the thing is the wrong for people that like sports such as soccer, football, baseball, basketball and other sports student would like to do. I think it would be best if you would let students like me do these sports. I think that the grade average should be a pass grade for students. A grade B average is wrong and should be a C or close to an D as long as it's passing. You should think about what you are doing to people that like sports. I like soccer, and it would wrong if I didn't get to try out for that all because I don't have a B as an average. You should learn a way how to improve grades without taking sports away from us the students. And that also goes for other activities. Think about, and thanks for your time.
