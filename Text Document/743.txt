Working alone is great but have you ever thought about the benefits of working in groups? For example, when you are working with a group of people it is easier to get ideas; for example, you can all put your thoughts tougher and find out the resolution. Also working with a group makes it faster to finish the tasks; some people take longer than others so It's good to have people around to help. Most people believe that working alone is better but working in a group is more beneficial for example, if there is a problem that needs to be solved it is easier to solve it because there are more people to figure out the problem and to give their opinions; which will help throughout the way. In other words, if one of the group members has trouble with the assignment another group member could help them out;instead of figuring it out by themselves. Working in groups could also make assignments become complete faster for example, some students while working alone take a long time and end up having to take their assignments home for homework; while in a group they can come up with a solution together and get it complete. It will also benefit the teacher because there won't be any late papers. There are benefits of working in a group, but there are also benefits of working by yourself for example, sometimes it gets loud in the group, and it will be hard for them to focus and get their work done also some students like to mess around and play fight instead of getting there work done. Even tho working in groups could cause a lot of talking and play fighting, it is still a more beneficial way for students. In conclusion, working alone is a better way for students to show what they know but working in groups is more helpful for students who are struggling.
