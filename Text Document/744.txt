Many schools have partnerships with companies that allow students to explore certain occupations through internships and shadowing opportunities. I would like to be selected to visit and learn about the work that interested me, because it would help me to be prepared on my future is a great opportunity. One of the reasons that I would like to be selected is because that can help me find the right job and to know how to do it, and to learn about it more, Because I can have more experience on doing my job. For example if I have to do one thing I should know how to do it and is better to learn something before doing it. Another reason is because not all schools have partnerships with companies to visit and learn about the work that interest students, that way I know what's the work that interests me by having that type of help on schools, By doing that type of help students learn new things and have more opportunity in life and have better jobs and have more money by doing the type of jobs that they want to have in there future is a great help for schools to have that. Students should already know what they want to learn about work. I think that is a great help for schools to discover whether they are interested in pursuing that type of employment, so student learn more, and they can find a job that they want that is why I want to be selected and visit and learn. Those are great opportunity to discover whether students are interested in pursuing that type of employment.
