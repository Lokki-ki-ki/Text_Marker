Dear, Generic_School. For some students, school is really far away for them, some student aren't able to be in school for there health issues or gifted youngsters, is a really wonderful thing that the schools are offering online classes for the kids, it can really be a big help for there parents and their children. My aunt, she has two children and one of them is gifted she can't walk normally, my aunt works every day and is really frustrated, she has to take her to school every day in the morning and take her home in the afternoon, from there home to school is like 30 minutes of a ride and the way back, there is no bus able to take her where she lives, during the winter she wasn't a fan of the cold, the kid mostly feel sick during winter season, during at that time every morning they go outside to the car, so my aunt can drop her to school she always felt sick, she was not able to attend school normally, it is really hard for my aunt, I told my aunt about the offer that the school are going to make, about the online school, and she really supports that decision she told me" That would it be a wonderful thing for me and my child" she is really joyful about the offer that the schools are making, I fully do support this offer, from the schools having online classes it does help a lot of kids and parents, with they struggle and timing at home, it will be a big help for the counties of Generic_City, we want all the kids to learn at same time, so they can be prepared for there future. Thank you for your time. Generic_Name.
