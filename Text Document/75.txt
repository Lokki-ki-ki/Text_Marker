Some school districts offer programs that allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years. I think it is a good idea for students to finish high school. Most students have a good ability in class like study, presentation, remember, ... But if they want to graduate earlier in three school years, they have to take off elective class in school, and take more time to study more subject class. During in the graduate earlier, students can enter college and finish it one year early, or they could have one year rest for work a job and thinking what they should study in college or university. However, some student have no good ability for study or student have second language can take more than three school years. They need time to get better in high school before enter college. Finally, in my point of view, I think we should allow high school students to graduate in three school years. But any students need more year to keep going in high school, we should let them do that.
