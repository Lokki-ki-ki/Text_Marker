Have you ever thought of just staying after school just to finish your homework, and wish not to do work at home when you can relax at home without thinking and stressing about doing your homework instead of remembering that you did it after school, that's why I think it's a good idea to have an, after school club because then the students will take advantage to finish there homework? And get help from and get more specific direction or other things that students need help on. So, I think if students go to after school club to finish there homework, etc. then the students won't have to worry about it at home and keep there grades in good shape. Also, to keep it simple it's important to have something important like this (after school club) to let the students know they have after school to help them complete there homework. And then, if students need help on completing there homework, etc. then the students can come to after school to get the help they need. And create a bond with other students by helping each other. Therefore I think there should be an after school club to help, do, and support. 3 gt
