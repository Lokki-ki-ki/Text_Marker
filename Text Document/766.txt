If we're always doing something then we're always busy. As long as we keep busy we'll sooner be done then later. For example if there's a project to be due, then that project must be due, and if the teacher gives you a due date it would be more motivating to finish it on time then later or even late. As long as the person doesn't give up and keep focus, then there's nothing to worry about. Staying on task isn't that hard, but if there are any distractions you must remove yourself from that situation and get back on track. Like imagine if a student was in class having trouble focusing because the surrounding students we're distracting or noisy. Then they may ask the teacher that they prefer working in the hall because the noise in the class is too distracting to them. The key is when it comes to doing something you must keep busy to reach that goal of finishing or being done. There are going to be some challenges, but you just need to overcome those challenges and learn from it it's all about learning and progressing as you keep working towards it. These are some of the reasons I think would help best to keep moving forward.
