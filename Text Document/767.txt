"Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something" yes people accomplish more when they are doing something. I believe that when people put in the effort to do more things that, it could help accomplish more for them in life. The reason why people accomplish more is that since day one they've been working hard and every chance they had of doing something productive that it would help them get to where they need to be in the future that they would take it. They knew that at a point of time when they get a job that they would have to take care of their parent when they older. This is why our parent's always push us and tell us to do better in school because they have already been through our situation, and it took them the hard way to learn, and they don't want us to learn the hard way they want us to learn the easy way so that it would be easy for us to get a scholarship. Back in the old days when our parents were growing up they had no technology to learn they had to struggle to learn, they had no bus to take them to school like how we do now days. But back in the old days is easier to get a job, and it was easier get into colleges because all they needed was a GED. But now we need a Masterâ€™s Degree, and a High School Diploma just to get a job that pays good enough for us to live by yourself and to start a family. Now it is very hard to get an academic scholarship because now you need at least a 3.8 grade point average (GPA) to get an academic scholarship. This why we need to be always doing something so that we can make our parents happy and also make ourselves happy that we've made an accomplishment. These are the reasons why I think we should do more, push ourselves more to get to where we need to be in life as a teenager because our parents can't keep telling us the same things over and over for us to listen we should just listen the first time so that we could make them happy and take care of them as when we get older and into our adult stage.
