In this school year I may be doing Homework club because I want it to get all of my homework done at school and to turn it in on time. Homework club is a go thing that I chose because there are teachers their to help you to get your homework done. Another go thing in homework club is that if you have trouble with your homework the teachers could help you with it. Kids will love if the school time never changed, so they could get home on time and even the bus driver and the teachers to. Well I think that the kids won't like it because lots of kids will be coming home late in night will the bus driver and the teachers if they live far from school. The after school stuff will be late into the night for the kids who will be staying and some teachers to and the bus driver to if the schools add one and a half hour to school each day. Kids will hate it if the school adds another one and half hour to school each day, so some kids hope that they do not started school at 8:00 in the morning, and they finished school at 5:18. Some kids will kind of love the idea that the school is adding one and half hour because some kids love school that they just don't want to go home and do their homework because you have to take your baby brother. Some kids will love to stay after school and the stuff they do and lots of kids will problem stay at homework club to get all their homework done for all their classes, so they do not get a bad grade if they did not do their homework. Some kids will like to come home at 6:50 or 7:00 because they could just eat their food, and they did all of their homework, and they could just watch T.V. Some kids will love the idea to add one and a half hour to school each day and some kids will hate the idea. Lot's kids will love the idea to stay after school for a long time, and they could come home late and some kids will hate to have to come home late if you have after school every day. Some kids will agree with this some won't agree with this.
