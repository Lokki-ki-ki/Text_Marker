Although most people would want to graduate and enter college or the work force a year early, others may argue that school should be the four years. One should be allowed to grow up. It should be mandatory to do four years of high school and here is why.First, school prepares students to face up and go against the real world, some students may need at least one more year in school to get their mind set for their future. Staying the extra year can make the student focus more on the classes that they're taking. If students decide to only go for three years, they can forget about sports or any after school activities they want to be in. They will have to put all their effort and energy into passing their after school classes. Second of all, students can be more independent. Students learn how to manage time to do work and extra activities. Students can also learn how to be more reliable and build up their confidence on doing things on task and on time. By doing the three-year only, they can't take breaks and if so the students won't have enough time to rest their bodies and be able to do what is asked. Some may argue, that students staying for three years are going to have enough knowledge to be able to take on the real world. However, students that have four years would have a more since of what they are going to do after the four years have passed. In conclusion, students should stay and have a better understanding of what is going to come up next.
