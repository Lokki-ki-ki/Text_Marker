True self-esteem comes from achievement because all the constant work and dedication put into the goals you have accomplished will continue to build up the confidence in yourself and the way you do things. Achievement is a major role for building anyone's self-esteem because it lets you know that you can accomplish anything you put your mind too. That feeling you get after you have finished something that you've been working on for a long time and doing a very well on is the best feeling ever. It makes it seem that nothing can get in your way no matter how hard it may be at first. Accomplishing one thing can be the start of many more achievements because once you have passed an obstacle, the ones that follow you know require you to work harder on. The confidence that you build makes you want to keep moving forward and work twice as hard. Overcoming something not only makes you feel good about yourself, but it keeps you motivated. It motivates you to keep going and setting higher goals for yourself. All it takes is one to make you want to succeed more. Wanting the best is never a bad thing because it is going to teach you that hard work and success is going to push you to become your best. Your true self-esteem takes time to build and small victories like passing a test or even winning a difficult soccer game for your school is the start of it. Little things like those are the small steps that will make you strive for bigger and better things in life. Eventually all that hard work will pay off, and you might be the top of your class. All it takes is commitment, dedication, hard work, and one small achievement. One achievement can have a huge impact and change the point of view on how you think about things. Changing the way things are thought of and done can make someone want to finish more and set more goals for themselves that one day they want to accomplish. Which helps better themselves and have confidence that they can do it.
