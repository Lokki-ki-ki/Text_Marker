I believe that doing nothing is accomplishing nothing, it gets you nowhere. Being active, and having a purpose are essential in being successful, also always doing something is better than doing nothing. To start off, being active can mean that you're accomplishing or trying to accomplish what you're doing. For example a boss of a company will always be trying to keep his business from loosing money, for he can't can't loose the company, so the boss will work towards saving the company. Secondly, having purpose in life, or a goal is better than dreaming about it; for instance, if you ask a successful person how they got to where they are, they won't say I dreamed for it, they'll say I worked towards my goals and didn't give, even if they thought they were going to fail. Finally, always doing something is better than doing nothing. For example, if a student goes to school just to sit around and do nothing, he or she is wasting an opportunity to learn, and get an education towards what they want in life. Some people might say, what if you fail pressing a goal; for instance, someone is trying to make money, or getting a job and keeps failing, they learn from the mistakes and keep the right mind set, if someone can do all that they'll flourish in the future. In conclusion, this is why I believe doing nothing is accomplishing nothing, as Thomas Jefferson said,"Determine never to be idle".
