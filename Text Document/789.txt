Well, I'm disagree with this statement, because no always your first impressions of something it's impossible to change. Sometimes you will have a lot of impressions of people, things,or animals.However, some percent of humans can not change their first impressions, because they think that, they are sure about their impressions, and there is when your mind has to change, so you can check first to make sure that yours impressions are rights, and I will support my response putting myself like an example; One day, I was at my house doing some work out, and then I started to having some straights impressions, That had the impressions that my girlfriend was cheating, with my best friend, so I get mad, because that impression was too difficult to believe, also you have to be carefully, when you have a bad impression of someone, you have to know how reaction will be. Also, you have to make sure that yours impressions is right, so I called my girlfriend, and we had a long conversation, but the thing is that I did not know, how tell or ask her my impression that I had with her and my best friend, however I was trying to change my impression, but my mind and my brain was confusing, because that impression can put me in problems with my girlfriend or somebody else, so the thing is that I did change my impression, knowing that not all your impressions that you think are rights, some impressions that you sometimes get, it's because you are not sure about something, or you no truths in that person who make you have a bad impression. My point of this statement is that the first impression it's possible to change, in the way that you, always will have a good impressions or bad impressions, so on my example is that sometimes you have to keep your impressions and just let the things happens or like passing the time you will know if your impression was right or not. Now, when I have impressions I keep for myself, that is one of the ways to change your first impressions, because that help me on my first impressions.
