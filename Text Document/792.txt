Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home?on my opinion students would not like the idea of taking more time to study, because nowadays students are very busy, stressed, and tired of school, they would not like to have to hear more stuff that has to do with school. Besides some people are smarter, and they could take the class just to see how that's going to help, but sometimes people don't try the stuff and that's why, they never know if they are going to like it or not. Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students from home by way of online video conferencing think, students are not going to have any benefit to attend classes from home. some students have to work, do stuff at home, or stay in school on other activities. Students sometimes, actually need some help with some classes, but they might not like to be taking the classes at home, The student taking the class at home could get distracted by so many things at his house. While some other students that have better grades and like school they could take the class, but they also will have homework and things to do at home. Students would not get any benefits by taking classes at home because, the online class could be also start teaching the same work that the teacher already teach you, or either the online class could be teaching different ways how to solve a problem that the student will get very stressed and after that it's not going to be able to learn something from it and instead helping the student the online class is going to make it more difficult.
