Dear, TeacherWhat do I think about working with people or working alone, I think both have great benefits, but it depends on the type of person if they are social, antisocial, or if they have been through stuff. But if I was to pick one I would choose to work with a group because of how many advantages there are, if your stuck, and you need help you can always ask for help from your group because there's more than one, working with your group is easier than working alone because you can do different parts at the same time meanwhile when you work alone it takes longer, it becomes more difficult if you need help and not knowing what to do. Working together gives us a bigger boost of an IQ because multiple brains are better than one and gives us a better over all grade or if the person that is working alone and is very smart he could find things easier. Working together could be fun because of the people you are working with or meeting new people in the group that you don't know and learning from them and what experience they have been through. Disadvantages are people are going to force the smarter person of the group to do all the work, if people choose the group they'll choose either the smart people of people that they get along with and mess around and not do anything, if the teacher finds out that the smart ones from the groups do all the work they'll get an f. People who choose people to be in their groups are going to abuse their power. People who chose to work alone would be struggling because work hard, and they would have to do all the work, it would be boring and long with no one to socialize, if were stuck you, and you needed help no one is there to help.
