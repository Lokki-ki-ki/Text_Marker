All tho some people say online classes is good. They have their reasons. Tacking online classes i good it has it's bad. If you take online classes you can stay home and don't you don't have to go to a school building, and you don't have to wake up early and go to school and you wouldn't have to go to school and see people you don't want to see and you don't have to eat the school lunch you can eat whatever you want to eat when ever you want to eat and you wouldn't have to follow and rule you can make you one rolls, and it would be ester to take a test when you online classes because you can look things up on the internet and pass you test but when you in school you have wake up early and get ready to go on the buss, and you have to go to your classes on time, and then you have to sit in a small class and sit in a desk and do your school work, and you have to follow rule like you would have to go to your classes on time and if you do make it to class on time then you would have to go to the tarty table and if you keep doing it you would happen more than three times you would have to go to ISS and what ISS is you would sit in this quit room without your phone and you can't talk anyone. And is you don't go to class at all they will find you and put you in IIS, and they will call you mom or dad or email your mom or dad telling them that you wasn't in school and i don't know about you, but my parents would get mad that i wasn't in school when they saw me go to school in the morning. And when you disrespect your teacher they will call security on you, and they will come and get you and tall to you. And if you get in a fight with a student then you will be in a big trouble the security will come and get you and it its awful they will call an amble and this time the principle and the police and parents will get involved, and the other person parents might press charges and that would not be good for you on your reared beauty when you apply for Cole they will see that you had a bad history and they won't want that tip of beaver in their school, so you would be hurting your Fulcher. And if you do or take drugs or sell drugs in school then you would be in so much trouble with the school and with the police and you parent and you could go well if your tithing and older and if your danger then that you would go to jive. And you would probably be kicked out of school, and you would have to go to a new school and love all your friends, and you wound have the same friends in the same school as you and that would be so sad, and you wound have to go to jell and earthing so I think it better to go to the online classes not that I get to eat all I want but beauty it a lot going on in schools that you have to got hour and you with not like it, I think it would be a good extent to try online classes
