I believe that if some school districts offer programs that allow to graduated in three years instead of the traditional four years, It couldn't be a good idea, Because most students following this plan must take course during the summer or in the evenings. One reason is that students may be not able to get the enough knowledge because the time in class must be less than the normal time in school. Second reason is that even if students graduated early from high school, students won't be able to take elective course. Third reason is that some students work during summer or at nighttime, so it couldn't be a good an idea. In conclusion I can say that if some schools offer programs that allow students to graduated in three years instead of four even if it sounds good it is not a good idea, because most of these students must take the course during summer, so there are some reason why it couldn't be the best way in order to graduate, including that some students may be not able to get enough knowledge, and some students have to work in summer.
