Businesses have adopted a four-day work week with each day consisting a ten-hour shift to conserve energy and resources. Schools are considering to follow this model. Although a four-day school week is what every student's want, I disagree schools should have to extended two hours more for a four-day school week because it leaves student less time to do school work and sports activities throughout the day, and it will ruin there sleep schedule. Schools should have to extended two hours more for a four-day school week. It will leave less time for students to do there school work and sports activities throughout the day. Student would normally leave school around three in the afternoon. If schools extended two hours more from the normal time they'll leave around five in the evening leaving them less time less for homework. Kids that have after school sports, have games and practice for two hours. The kids would've come straight to do there homework and other things. Schools should not have a four-day school week. It will ruin students sleeping schedule. If students are still up late trying to finish there homework, are getting less sleep. Students that have after school sports would stay up later to finish up things they haven't finished. The students that come to school tired always gets less sleep. If a student have a test the nest day and stay up studying, they will come to school too tired to take the test. Others may say having a four-day school week would be great. It will be less stressful for students. Students won't have to worry about school as much, and it will leave them more time to do homework on the days off. However, I still believe that having longer hour for school is not healthy for the students. Schools shouldn't have to extended two hours more for a four-day school week because it leaves student less time to do school work and sports activities throughout the day, and it will ruin there sleep schedule.
