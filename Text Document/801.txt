Sometimes knowledge is very helpful, but sometimes imagination could be helpful to. When I was seven years old I imagined many things, but they never happened. When I turned 13 years old things changed, and they were not the same as I imagined before. I thought that I was gonna accomplish those imaginations in my head, but they never did. One day I noticed that imaginations were not better than knowledge. One day my mom and I were suffering because we couldn't get to the other side of the river, and we decided to build a boat to get to the other side, and we made it. The knowledge we used was unexpected because we never thought we were going to make it to the other side. Knowledge is very helpful when you are struggling with something, but you also use imagination because you think before building or making something. I believe that imagination could be important sometimes, but knowledge is more helpful, and we use it very often. Imagination could change things but not better than knowledge. We might always think that imagination is better I agree with you but if you think of how easy it would be use knowledge while you are struggling than you would understand the differences. Knowledge is very helpful in many ways and very often. I disagree with the prompt saying that imagination is better than knowledge. Always try something first and if it doesn't work try using something else. You will always find the solution on something different just like I did with my mom. Always think of something that you can use to solve a problem.
