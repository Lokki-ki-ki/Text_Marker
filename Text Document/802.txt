The benefits of working with a group or working alone. Which do you feel is more beneficial. In my opinion, I believe working with a group is more beneficial because a group creates different ideas, team work to win the competition, and entertain the audience. First, each person of the group has a different thought and different ideas. They share their ideas to create incurable, different, complete thoughts as a group. Some ideas are very difficult to reach the goal, but it is passable to think together and make it happen. Team work to win the competition is to work together. Each person has to play a different correcter's and roles. Some of them in the group they have to support the main correcter in the stage or back of the stage. Rehearse time to make it inconvenient to be with family members to reach their accomplishment. Finally, entertaining the audience is most important to each group member. An audience is the people come to enjoy the show, each of the group member are work hard to convince and entertain the audience. Each group member has one leader to follow their roles in specific time to make the show more interact. I think, the wonderful job can be done working together as a team, developing their ideas and creating entertainment in their performances. And, also, their task is to give the fans happiness and good time. Team members, families, and teachers will feel proud. I think working with a group it is more joyful.sincerely:Generic_Name
