I agree to the first expression, because it has meaning behind it, and it makes a lot of sense. And It's possible for it to change.my life was complicated at first, but I always thought of a solution to escape my problems, as when I was little my life was a living hell, I always got laugh at, even if I didn't have a reason to get caught at, so I saw through my life and thought there's was a reason to live anymore, but then I ask people about there life, and they told me everyone loves them, and that hurt me very much, so I gave up and didn't ask anyone for help. Until one day. One person in my class told me if I was okay, and I responded back saying, ''I want to end my life'' and he in tears, gave me hope and told me if I wanted to play soccer in his team, and I told him, I will think about it, and after the day pass, I became a new member of his team, I practice so hard, his coach saw in me potential and told me I should be the captain of the team, and it made me so happy, I started asking my parents to buy me stuff like food, and stuff I needed for traveling with the rest of my friends, so then the days pass through, and I woke up so bright, I couldn't wait to get ready to travel with my friends, so when I arrive to the school, I started practicing and getting ready to play for the team, then I saw behind me my team with a soccer ball, to get ready for traveling, when we started packing up, we saw this huge bus that was so cool, even a giant could ride in it, so we ran as fast as we could to the bus and I got the first seat in the bus, so my friends got jealous of me, and start throwing papers, but I was so happy I ignore the team and started thinking of the soccer championship, then waste my time fighting for nonsense. The next day we all woke up and the bus stop us at a food shop, were they sell all kinds of stuff, and I was so sad, I forgot my money, but I didn't forget to carry my lunch, so we all finish eating and came back to the bus and travel again, and traveling we saw through the window amazing places, until we stop and ran out of gas, and stop at middle of the road, I was so mad, I scream very hard, and threw papers, until the teacher told me to calm down, he told we could instead have fun playing soccer at a private place, because it didn't matter if we didn't make it to the league, what matter to are teacher, is to put smile on are faces.
