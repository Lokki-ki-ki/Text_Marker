Well i this that is a good idea for all the students to be guided and know more about a career after high school younger age. Some reasons why they should know more about a career at younger age are:They will be ready after they graduate and know'ING what are they going to do. It will be easier after you graduate you don't have to worry about what career are you gonna study, and it gonna make you more responsible. Some students don't like this idea to be guided at a younger age they don't want to worry that much, some student just want to finish high school first, and they have 4 years to decide what are they gonna do after high school and what career are they going to pick. In conclusion staring knowing about college in a younger age is no a bad idea, it will help you a lot, and you will be more confidence, but they are other students who prefer to know more about college and what career they should pick after they graduate.
