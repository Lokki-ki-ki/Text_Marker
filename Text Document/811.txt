Yes I agree with Churchill's statement for the role that failure and because he never lost the enthusiasm of to keep up and that happened with the role that consists of going from failure to failure but never loss the enthusiasm. The role is something that consists in a good job, but you have to know how you use because if you don't know how you use your role is going to failure or if some people that you have don't know use that thing. But if that happened don't loss the enthusiasm because if you want that your role going up and make more money or others things, don't loss the enthusiasm, and you have to study more about role for learn more and for that you role don't go failure because in you role you can do new things, and you can do jobs with others people that have role you can work with they like a group and work for a big company where the can pay you much money and with that you can do another company more big by yourself about role or if you want to you can do a different company that you like it, you can do a better job only you have to learn more about the job that you want to take always if you want to take a good job you have to study first before you take the job like when you study more about role because if you don't study more for different job you job is going to failure like the role always happened in jobs that you don't know use but never loss the enthusiasm if you like the role, or others things. The enthusiasm is something like when do you like something like a better job, role, or others things that you like to do that's enthusiasm or when you like to do a good mechanic or a good doctor, and you say I going to do this because I like it is my dream do a good doctor or a good mechanic or others things, but that's the enthusiasm do something that you like to do and never loss the enthusiasm because if you lost the enthusiasm you're never going to do anything that you want or that you like don't loss the enthusiasm never do like Churchill's he never lost the enthusiasm because he wants to keep up with the role, and he like the role he studies more, and he learns more about role. This is my ideas and examples about this question about the role that you have to know how use the role and if you don't know use you role is going to failure without loss of enthusiasm.
