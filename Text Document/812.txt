This is what the prompt is asking me to take a Position on this Issue. And to Support my response with reasons and Specific examples on this prompt. So this is what the Counterargument is about and what it once me to take the Position and Issue on is this Should people make their own Decisions, or should they seek Guidance from experts and Authorities about life's Important matters? People should make their own decisions because in one point of another there's always going to be a time that we are going to have to make a decision on something like for example every four year's there's always a selection for a new government and what I mean by new Government I mean like a new President that when we have to make a Selection that a decision that we are making for our self but in this situation we are looking for our own Committing beneficial so that why it is good for us to star making our own decisions for our own self and specially for us as young Adults that we are in high school and that some of right now we are asking some bad choices, but we can change that by staring making good decisions or at list trying to make the right decision in school.
