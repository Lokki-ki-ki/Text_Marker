The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too falling short but in setting our aim too low and achieving our mark. I believe that if set your goal high in order to mark your goal it does come high it cuts short but when you have nothing and your too low your but you try hard you achieve to your mark. I agree with Michelangelo that you don't need to be the best as long as you put effort in to it, you can do anything but at the same time I disagree with these quotes because you don't need your setting to be low it can be high at the same time it really doesn't matter how you can achieve your mark no matter what way or path you decide to take life take to different place makes you do different decides. For example right now am I doing a sol if I aim to high in order to pass and reach 12th grade and to get my diploma my aim can a low and I can still have an achieve my mark. It really doesn't matter how much effort you put in to something because in the end you can always reach your goal. Everyone goes through this everyday or at some point of their lives like work, school, etc. This can also be found in the human race. Another thing that I feel that the quote means is that people like to set low standards on themselves.
