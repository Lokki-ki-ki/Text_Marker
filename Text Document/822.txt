"To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else a greatest accomplishment"I agree with Emerson's statement it's important to be yourself always and think about your future, depends on own decisions what do you want to be also we can to achieve our goals. In the world we have so many opportunities, everyone can do it, all can try no matter how many times you make a mistake, no matter what the people say about you. Just believe in yourself and be happy. Even if you don't feel sure about something like one day when I was working I was not sure about what I was supported say like I was scared cause was my first day at work and that what the costumer going to say. Sometimes i don't want talk cause its little hard speak another language but when they say you will be fine, or they say positive things about me, that's means that always you find people that they support you, and they give to encourage and different ways. Many times it's important to take off the negative mind and be positive.at school see kids that also have the same and also I remember when I start my first days of the school was like that but if you be yourself and try to make you goals you can do more than you think. it's better to focus in your own future than in someone else's banishes, last Saturday my friend's team won the final and I was so proud about the, its important belief and try to support other people because they can make great accomplishment also. Finally, the best way to try got the greatest accomplishment is being yourself and believe in yourself.
