To conserve energy and resources some businesses have adopted a four-day work week and consisting of 10 hours per day, everybody is different everybody does they want so can be good or can be bad. I'm disagree because for me is the same thing that the businesses adopted a four-day week that consist of 10 hours of work, because if they work the 6 day's at week doing 8 hours at the end is the 40 hours at week same with if you work 10 per day in four days at the week. When the businesses make the people work the 10 hours per day in four days week the people get more tired and most people do workout in the morning or in the night and I think that if you work 10 hours per day you don't going to do your workout because your going to be tired and the only thing your going to do is sleeping the school follow the same model and extending school day two hours for some student is going to be good but at the time no because if the students come to school for four day and add two more hours they will be in home doing nothing, and they can play all day in video games, and that cant get more energy, for other student can be bad because some students work after school and that can affect them. As you sometimes read you get benefits and sometimes disadvantages one of the best benefits can be that you conserve energy and one of the best disadvantages is that your body can be tired, but at the end is going to be the same thing that businesses want four-day week that consist of 10 hours per day or that businesses work 8 hours per day and there be the 40 hours at week referent with school they don't have to follow the businesses because students need to learn.
