Nothing comes thought until you work for it! I feel comfortable or confident about this quote because once you already mastered something you keep feeling as if you are still missing something, or maybe you think what you already have is not enough so, you decide to start working on a different thing or project just to keep making grow what you have. In this life nothing comes easy, you have to work harder to build something or what you have in mind, once you build what you got in your mind you still probably not going to stop trying to build more than what you already have, because you already tasted how's it feels having much, so you keep going and build more and more only because you don't feel that what you got is enough, or you liked how is felt having much." Dreams never come thought, until you make them happen." That can also describe or talk a little, about the quote of Ralph, because when you have a dream and that dream get into the reality you are going to think like Ralph, you're going to feel that is not enough for you, and you are going to start trying to do something else to make grow what you got, sometimes this can be taken as a selfishness because you want more than you have but, if someone doesn't feel good with what they have they can keep working to make it grow. In my opinion I agree with the thoughts of Ralph because if I have something and if exist other way to make grow what I have, I would definitely going to work for it, so I can make it happen; hard workers always receive their rewards in the future.
