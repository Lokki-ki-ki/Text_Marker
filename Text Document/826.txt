I agree that technology had a positive effects on people lives because is help them figure out some stuff or distract them by listening to musics, watch a movie, or play games. Technology is something that people use some much for example to find a job, to business, shopping, or teaching. Some people used to make music or movies like all those actors and actress they used technology. Is so popular that technology is everywhere for anybody went to used. It is a nature is help other people too, it very differentiates when we used for different language for example with can use to translate any words in different language used technology to call people, friend, family, or parents some people may say that it can make your lazy when I meant is that we can't even walk or to nothing but is not true we have machine that work with technology sport, and it helps us find stuff, or we can even have a jobs by technology, and we can stay home every time. And it helps students for written an essay or taking text, quiz, or exam. School is a place that we can find technology people and much stuff relent to it. People used technology because it was created to make stuff a little simple for an example we used technology right now for taking ours SOL why don't used paper for that so that why technology make stuff more easily for people. On another hand technology is very expensive one if we need to buy. A cell phone is a part of technology is very popularly because it helps us communicate with people we don't need to go the house we just call or test message and we are good to go. In the environment people used technology so much that we can even account the number what I try to say it technology is every benefit for young and adults people to used. We pretty much used designed jewelry, house. Everything we do is technology.
