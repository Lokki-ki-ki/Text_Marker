Introduction: technology allows people to complete many tasks without having contact with others. People can check out books, shop and play game without speaking to another person. Reason:I think the people can't do nothing without help because it is necessary to have help from others. People who don't us technology I think is negative because without technology the people can do nothing for example they cant to have contact with other or for a job. I believe the people who use the technology can to be positive because can do anything, how have a job or the technology can go to be negative to because somebody uses the technology, how in her house, for example; the child can cause a problem with they eye, or another thing more. I think people can't do nothing without help of other, because it is necessary to have help from others, or help of the technology. The technology can help at the people for a job, but the technology can effect to the family to, for example; at the child, to use technology is good, but I think we can put a limit for her effect to have. The effect have the technology with the family is can cause a problem with other or for a job, because someone uses the technology. I think without technology people don't don't can to have a job because somebody use technology for thereby the technology, so I can to be positive, However the technology have effect at the people and help at the people with a job, and for to have contact to with another people.
