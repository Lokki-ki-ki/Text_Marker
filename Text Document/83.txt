John Lubbock wrote "Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it." When it comes down to it though I think our own character traits are formed by influences around us. I say this because even if we can say what we are, the surrounding things can change that for the better or the worse. What can change us can be the people around us, the surrounding things, and even the friends we make. An other thing that can influence us is our family since DNA can give us some of our parents personally and the way they treat us can change our personally as well. Now other people who say we can choose to have their own opinion as well. They think we can choose our own character traits. They say this because once you put your in mind on it, you'll be able keep it is like that. I also thought this as well but that change because my family and friends were totally different they what I was going for and that's how I became what I did. They also think it would be worse to let pick on its own since it would be unhealthy. This is understandable because it would mean thinking less about it, but I think it is more helpful since being around people who are kind and helpful can and will rub off on you. Those are my reason to why I think our own character traits are formed by influences around us.
