Online schools is a good idea but not for everybody, some people do good being homeschooled, but some just cant do it. Online class are not easy not anybody can pass that's why they are not meant for everyone. Being homeschooled is nothing like regular school you don't have to wake early, you get to choose what time you do your work. Not having to wake up early every day is nice but knowing you have to get something done right after you start is not fun and specially if you're not getting the help you need not being able to ask the questions you have makes it a lot harder, you also have to try and do your best because if you fail you can't talk to your teacher about helping you make it up and helping you pass it like regular school. If you are homeschooled you missing out the fun in regular schools not talking about class meaning all the fights, all the fire drills, all the dances and friends sometimes having trouble in regular school I always tell myself I need to drop out or take online classes, but homeschooled is not just for everybody and probably at least 60% of homeschooled students either don't finish or go back to regular school.regular school is better than homeschooled or online you have better chance of passing if you work with other people and get help and give help because in life we get what we give. Trying your best at anything is all that matters not giving up keep trying one day you're going to make it.
