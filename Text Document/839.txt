I agree because when you tell someone the truth you have to be honest to each other the whole time and to let the other person know what they are feeling inside them that they do not want to hear from the other person of what they just said to them. Another reason why you should be honest with each other is to tell them the truth what's going on, because if you don't wanted to keep it inside for so long you should tell your trusted friend or tell an adult that you trust the most and tell them what's going on. After you are finish talking to your trusted friend or to an adult the best thing to do is tell your friend that you have been not telling the truth to them and tell them the truth what's going on. After you finish telling the truth the other person that you trusted on for so long they will never forgive you of what you just did. And that's why it's important to let the other person know the truth.
