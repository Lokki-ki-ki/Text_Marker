Our good behavior is something to motivate us as a way of thinking or, feeling as one on self to be someone important in our life. Because, it described us by having a good conduct, a positive personality, and an attitude. This is something the help us to have a good success in life. Because if we want to do something in our life we always need to be positive. My first reason is having a good conduct it helps us to be a better person, everywhere we go. Because, is going to be useful example: If the students go to the school every day; they have to behave with the teachers. They need to be respectful with them. We must do everything that they say because, we are smarter people to understand what is good and bad for us. My second reason is a positive personality is also important. It helps us to be more successful. For example: If we are taking a test; we always need to be positive instead of being negative or, if we have bad grades we can ask the teacher to help us. We must do our home works, and extra works, so we can improve our grades. My third reason is a good attitude is also important because it described who we are. For example: I helped my friend to find a new job where I work. So, she got an interview for the job. I told her to have a good attitude, so they will, might accept her were I work. I think is important to help others. We always need to have a good attitude, so we can be someone in our life. Because, we are smarter people, and we know what is important for us. Also is going to help us to be successful in life. We must be positive and do what is important to us.
