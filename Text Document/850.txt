I have seen a lot of people in a bad attitude because something happens that they don't likes examples= 2. Failed in a test that's an attitude of worrying.3 More examples like you and your friends got into a fight, and they are always in worry that if we could be friends one again and that depends on their attitudes. 4. Another one is when your parents get into a fight that makes your kids in a worry thinking that there might be a separation between them.5. Some people are worry while taking a test worrying that they might fail the test.6. Another example is getting bad grades similar to failing.7. And more getting bullied and no one even stands up for them that's a depressed attitude and might decide to oil them self.8. More attitude is acting cool in a class and behaving not well enough and even cussing at a teachers.9. There is another point when you've got an attitude don't show to your friends you probably don't want them to worry too and if you do that way you are spreading your worry and everyone will be and that is not good.
