I am writing to support the idea that students have to choose or identify a care before they enter high school.First, I support the idea on students choosing a career before they get to start high school. That was they will know what they like to be when they graduate from high school. For example some students will become professional sport players, architects, doctors, etc. Because thinking on becoming someone very important in the society at a young age will make them proud of them selves, and that would lead them in to a successful pat. Secondly, for young students will be easier to get to where they want at a you age. Because they are young, they don't have to think a bout anything ells but studying. For example, they don't have to think a bout pain bills, or taking care of the family. The only thing they have to worry a bout is studying, and follow their dreams to be what they want to be. In conclusion, these are my reasons on why I support the idea that the student need to identify a career by the time they enter high school. Thank you for your time and attention.
