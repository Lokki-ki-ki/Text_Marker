I agree which this to say the first impression is impossible to change, To be honest which my self friends and people etc..., Be direct with the other person, Say the true and respectful, Be comprehensible, understand the another person, some day of this week my friend bring a pant and I'm saw him, my fist expression was ''NASA this not going which you, so I will honest with him, if somebody tells me something that is not pleasing for me, I'm sure that I going to put my impression face, and maybe the other person don't like, but it's impossible to change my impression, I will direct which the people, if the people don't like my impression I'm sorry for them, yeah maybe it's not correct to say the fist impression, I'm agree for that too, and I understand that some people put angry when I do that, but I can't change my altitude because I'm like this, it's the same with the another people they got them own impression but in different ways, that's for that I'm agree, and I understand that is so important to me because I don't know if the other person feel bad when I say the first impression, that's why I need to improve my impression, some people and my friends are annoying with me for this, and that's why I need to practice respect to myself and the another people. The fist impression is bad idea because if I'm in the job and my boss tell me that my work is not like this, and I say my fist impression that's sure that my boss will put annoying because maybe he tries to teach me, and the fist thing that I do is my impression and is not a good impression, some impressions are good because when some girl look beautiful my impression going to be wow I like how they look today, so impression can be good or bad, the impression can be used in different ways, can use in positive and negative forms, so we decide what kind of impression to used, but a lot a time we only used a negative impression in that is not correct, for example if i or some friends bring something or do something we need to do a positive impression, but we always give a negative impression and that is not correct we need to encourage this person, but we only do negative things. Having a good impression we are more than we can imagine because everybody respect to you and nobody got problem with you, and that's a opportunity to a lot of ways in your life.
