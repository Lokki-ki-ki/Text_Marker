My Mom, she always shares wisdom with me and shows how to be a wise person, and she also introduces me to this world. One day she decided to leave everything behind and start all over, because she wanted us to have a better life in the United States. She taught me what's right and wrong, she told me "son always go for what's good but don't go through the bad path." When you learn from others experience you become a better person.However, don't learn from bad influences they'll bring you down. Friends that are doing bad things are influences you don't need to follow their actions in order to become a better person just talk to a wise person they might give you good advice. My Grandmother also shared how to do the right choices. Once she told me doing the right choices will always have a reward. So I always remember to do right choices. If you learn how to be a wise individual other people will follow your steps like M.L.K. and his famous I have a dream speech he was an example of wisdom. It is important to learn from the experiences of others because you want to be known as a person of character. Imagine being the person, the person you want to follow. Do what your Mom says trust she's not lying one day you might not get that same advice wisdom shows what is true and what is right this is important in a person's life because you develop those skills that your Mom and Dad show you and use them when you grow up.
