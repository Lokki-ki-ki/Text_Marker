I really think that, Ralph Waldo Emerson, was right when he wrote this or most of the people see it that way its like you went to collage, and you get a degree and come back and still living with your parents when you could move out and get a job save some money to buy a house but if you're still living with your parents it will be the same, because they will keep looking at you like a little child into you start to get your own things for them no matter how old you are they will look at you the same way that look at when you were born, I think that when Ralph wrote this he wanted to mean this. For the rest of the world you already a growth man or woman when you get your life together and get your own car, house, and family that you will look out for, and you will do anything for them like your parents did it for you, and it will be the same story but from a different side and the one who's telling the story, and you will never what your children to grow you will look at them like your child the rest of your life I did not get into I sow my older sister taking care of her daughter it was there when I start look my life from a different side I might not be a fully grow man but I move out my house when I was 15 and I thought it will hard to keep up we the rest of the world I think before you take your own path and stop worried about the rest of the world that's when you really grow up family is first, second, and third. I think that the best way to grow is do you first and there is no need for you to move out you just need to look at the rest of the word from a different side and that's when you really grow is not age or nothing like that is on you just don't worry about nobody beside your family and your friends.
