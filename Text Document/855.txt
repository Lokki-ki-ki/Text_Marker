The great artist Michelangelo I'm thinking he is the best artist because he said most of us lies not setting our I am too high and falling short. Setting and achieving they work in the same position I think so Michelangelo he knows that, if the achieving is low the setting low too because is the same he's doing good jobs also if, he gets a new job he had more talent. I think the setting is too low because the system is too low, so he needs good system and good setting and then everything is work after than he can work very good .my recommend to Michelangelo is change the sitting if he changes the sitting for one high he needs more recommendation for he jobs he needs doing a lot to doing for he jobs and the setting is too short he needs one bigger because the short is a lot problem.Also, I have one more recommendation if you need the new system just change is better make sure the setting is not short because if the setting is short always are low but if the setting is bigger the setting is more high and not falling.50% I agree but the other 50% NOI agree because he has nice talent, and he does nice jobs also I disagree because the setting is very short and low but if you get my recommendation is better, and he has good idea, but he has bad idea too so let me get to agree because I like he history agree because he used setting and achieving is two things very important on this history he has nice history my position is when I read the history is to confuse but now I understand what he's doing.example: just change the short setting to a bigger setting if better for you this litter example thank you for read Michelangelo remember don't forget my recommendation.
