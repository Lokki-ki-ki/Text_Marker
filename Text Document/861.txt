The matter of always doing something is great. Some say if you to idle which means always hanging out or not doing much. You're not busy at any means your just wasting quality time, that could be used doing anything productive like getting important stuff done. At the end of the day the person that has accomplished the most has a better chance of living better, they don't have as much stress on thinking that they still have to get so much done but has not done anything. The day i laid in my bed not doing anything was the day that I felt sorry for my self that I couldn't get up and do something simple ass get simple hours done like feed the animals or put to wash my clothes. Then I realized the next day when I went to sleep earlier the night before, I woke up with a better outlook of the day I got stuff done and had extra time, to do what I like. In my free time I enjoy working with vehicles, change oil and all the main functions of a car. I stay busy to a point for example I don't want to stay up all night doing something that is not worth the time. They are people I know that work from 10 hours up to 14 hours a day, it's not an office it's outside annual labor it's not fun. They still get home and do what is needed. That shows there is always time to do what's needed. If the type of person that works 8-hour shift's you have plenty of time to be productive and get something good done. It's been shown by scientist that human that does the most each and every day, are likely to live longer. The reason is you're not dealing with all that stress of getting things done.
