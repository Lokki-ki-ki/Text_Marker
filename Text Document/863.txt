Today I would like to explain to you the benefits of working with a group. In my opinion working with a group make things more easy and fun because students have the chance to exchange ideas and also learn more from each others it ALS help us to see things from different points of view. First, working with a group make things easier for students because they will all work together in each part of the assignment, one student can do the research while the other one write the information the other student can be looking for graphs or other information that they might need, students also get to have fun by working with a group because they can talk to each others and also laugh from their mistakes. In addition, students have the opportunity to learn no just the topic of the assignment but also learn from each other, working with a group gives us the opportunity to exchange ideas and thoughts it also helps us to see the different points of view, by working with a group we also get help from each others because if one student does not know the answer to a question the other students might have the right answer. Last, for some students working with a group makes them feel more comfortable because they can help each other and support the different positions and ideas, by working all together they will have better result, and they will learn more by having discussions and sharing their different opinions. In conclusion working with a group have more benefits because the students learn more and have better results, they learn more from each other, they discuss the different points of view, and they also learn to respect and listen to the different positions that they have.
