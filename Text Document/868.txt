I think if your good and sports you can participate in sports. But you at least have to try to do better at school. Because if you don't them you can't participate in sports like compete with others school or team. It is so cool because, one time I compete with other school in basketball and volleyball. But we lost In volleyball but in basketball we won. I was So happy because you get so exited and then nervous because then you think that you're going to lose, but you never know IG you don't try. So I think that if you have a C or B you can still make to the team or do some sports. When I won I was with a C average and my coach. Didn't care she put me because I was good. And that what I think principal, so please don't change the rules. And if I want to do and activity well if I have a C than, she at least can check my conduct in class. Or maybe some students don't have a B average they could get and C, and they could be one of the best. But the principal want to change the rule right.
