That older students can assist with the younger students and the younger students can pair up with the older students. I think this way because the older students can help with the subjects of the younger student that does not know about. And that the older student can learn something about the younger student that he/she does not know about ether. To have more understanding of the old and young student. And to work together as one. The older students have known the past year before the young. They know about the subjects they did and know what to do. This can help the young because when it comes to questions, they can do something about it. They can give examples of what troubles them when it comes to a hard question. To show what feels how hard or easy in class, projects, work, and homework can be. The younger students have a fresh start to 5th grade to middle school or 8th to freshmen. Other students think that middle or high will be easy. Or others think that it will be hard for them self. To open up lockers, find there classes, etc. But by the older students can help them what works best for the student. They can understand of what to do in class. Because of the help of the older students. And they can also teach the other young students of the teaching of the older students. The program can help each other by if they want to be helpful and to work the path to be easier Maybe something won't be east on work in school. If the student wants to ask questions, to show hints, or how It's going to be in the next grade. The program can make everything much more simple. And this is why that the program can help with the younger students and the older students can know something about the student.
