I would say that I agree because If you want a successful life you have to learn how to make your life easy showing to the world that you are special that you can be a nice person does not matter what the other people said or think, you have to take everything with calm and if you have problems you have to solve it with a good attitude because if you get angry you do not go to solve in a good way that is why you have to be a good person with everybody, have peace in your soul, and the last but not least have a good connection with the people that are around you, you have to put a happy face to everything that coming directly to you. When you are a good person with all people you made them feel good, and also you feel it, because when you are a good person you are saying that you are different to everybody, because in this world we can see that a lot of people are so bad but that does not mean that all of them are aquanaut you do not have to stop being a nice person just because you know people that have a bad attitude, the only thing that you have to do is be away from all of them and give to yourself a chance to know that really think like you that can make you feel as in family, this people will make you feel better because you are showing to them that you can have people around you that can make you have a better life and also more success, for example I am a good person with all people, with my family, and with my friends; I am gonna told you something about my friends they are special I love them, and they love me you know why because I took my time to know them, now I know what they like or how they spend their time and the most important they think that I am a success person that make has a good attitude with them and I want them in my life and I think they will have a nice life because I see in them that they will be very success people. I think that have peace is an important part of your life, because from your soul you get a lot of good feelings that make you feel comfortable, but in the same way sometimes you can have something and that make you be uncomfortable but there is you have to try to have peace, I know that can be so difficult, do not have peace inside you can affect you in some ways in your life, I think that to feel peace you have to do things that really like you or find something that you can always make and is not bored and also not get angry so easy because just for one problem you can be mad for a weekend or more and that is not good for you there is anything better than have peace, when I was 12 my younger brother did something that do not like me in that time and I still remember since the first day I can tell you is not good to have that mind inside me, I am 20 now and I think that mind is going to be with me the whole life, but I'm trying to do not remember but when I remember I tell to my self that I love my brother, and we are so close, and he is a person that is there to hear me and when I talk with him, I tell him everything that is happening in my life I feel peace in my soul. A good connection with people that are around you can help you to have a good attitude because if you meet people that always are positives or always talk about things that are going to help in your life they can influence in your future because they know what they want in their life or what is bad for them those people are nice to meet, are interesting to hear, you can learn something's from them, and you can share some ideas, but in your life you will know a lot of people maybe good or maybe bad some of them are going to be nice, they will ask you to go outside a lot of days, or they will inmate you to have fun, and you will think that those people are the good for you to be success, but let me tell you sometimes the good people are the ones that offer to you not a party if not something that can be good for your life something that is not going to affect your future, and I know sometimes you are going to feel that the people that want to help you are the bad ones but not you are wrong, I know a person that I saw a great future he studied with me, he always had good grades, he always did homework, he was a nice guy this happens in the event grade, but when we attend the nine grade he starts to meet people that they had bad grades they DI not do homework and I think they do not wanted a future, some months later his grades goes down but was because he always when I ask him where he was, he was going something bad with his new friends, and then he turns to one of them, and I think he does not attend college, this is why I am saying to have a successful future you have to be with people that are going to help you in your future. I think we all agree after these three points that were; a good person with everybody, have peace in your soul, and have a good connection with people that are around you, this make me think how important is had a good attitude, show a good attitude to everybody, and have a good attitude does not matter what is happening in your life.
