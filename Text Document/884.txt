I agree with Emerson's statement about individuality because, I think if you want to do something be yourself in the born world then you have to change the style of living, make yourself change the way you want it to be, everyone has a different thinking and opinions about their life. However, sometime is really hard to chief that goal, some other people can't do what they want because is taken a lot of time and fail, when people are doing the something the same over again, but maybe when they are change to different, I feel everyone go work so early on the morning make people over time feeling exhausted and born, some people work at 3 or 4 make them tired, but they can't change anything because they have no choose about their life, but people can change to a different thing, so they can be better person. People change what they do a lot, but also they scare if they're going to fail it, a lot they don't really take an other step with something new so whatever they do, people need to change the way they think about thing around them, so they can make decision about they like or don't like. Everyone got a good choose or a good decision about their life but the important is to define to choose that they make and design more about they decision, so they can become better, in world have a lot of famous people that make a lot of differences about their life, a lot of stories before they are become famous person, they all normal people just like everyone else, but they just be themselves, so they become a different person when they planed their own way to go or to do on their life. The world not choose you, but you have to choose the world.
