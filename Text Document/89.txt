In this case in my school I think, should be followed the model to, but a little differently, because school is not businesses, would extending, making two hours but not everyone, want to, but if people understanding it a good extending because if we conserved the energy and resources we can proved such as land minerals or natural energy, Example: The environment will have more conserve energy. The more important is how to know adopted the hours to conserved energy, we will do for provide good and have extraordinary successful.
