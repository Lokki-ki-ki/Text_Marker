Most people will just act all childish just because they are having a bad day without even thinking that it can ruin their future. Bad impressions usually lead to failure, it can ruin opportunities, and people can also get themselves mistaken. I agree that someone's first impressions are almost impossible to change because it can affect their future. Firstly to begin with, first impressions usually lead to failure in life when they are bad impressions. People need to learn how to act politely even if they are full of sorrow inside without showing it. When people make bad impressions about themselves, it always makes it harder for other people to see who that person really is. Loosing big opportunities always lead to a challenging future. Secondly another, bad impressions always ruin many opportunities for people, especially young people. It is an everyday thing in the United States. People can lose job opportunities, and it makes it harder for them to get a second chance. Second chances are huge deal, no one can live without them. If someone did some awful things and did not get another chance, then that person just lost an opportunity of a lifetime and is going to regret it for the rest of his or her life. Also, people get themselves mistaken all the time because of that. Other people will never see that person for whom he or she really is when that person is acting in an unusual way which is not normal. They will look at that person as he introduced himself as. They would not want anything to do with him. Furthermore, they would also think that he is mean even if he is just having a bad day. In conclusion, no one should let problems make them show a bad impression about themselves. Everyone has problems. They just need to learn how to control themselves and not make any scenes about it to embarrass themselves. They should know that the consequences are real, and they are not games. People need to grow up, be responsible, act fairly, and be happy.
