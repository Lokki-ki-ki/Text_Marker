DEAR PRINCIPALAll the students should perform community service because the adults are out there working the whole day and when they come back home they want to drive on a clean community. The students when they do community service they are learning about their future life it is like a job you can't slack off. The adults don't have enough time to do community work with their job and all that but who has more free time than the students or kids. That is not all when we clean up our community our children our going to live in a clean community, so help make a better future. The students may this is corny, but they know to that they want their children to in a clean community and for their grandchildren. The community service could be any not just cleaning up also help tutor your neighbors' child with homework and anything outside your house helping is community service. You can babysit your neighbors kids and other peoples kids to that could count as community. The teachers could have like a game where who ever does the most community service gets like a prize of the class.There would be like when a student gets suspended they have done community work and give him or her an hour or more time.So principal encourage more students to do community service during the day or after school.
