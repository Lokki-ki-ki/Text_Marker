I think students doing home assignments will not benefit the student, because it doesn't help the student grasp the same kind of concepts like other students that do go to school. The reason why I personally don't like homeschooling is because if I'm at home I wouldn't get my work done. I'd be distracted by looking at my dog and looking at what my mom would be doing. Another reason why I would not like it is because I'm not getting the same kind of education like most of the other students. I wouldn't have the chance to learn with my classmates or go on trips to historical monuments and historical museums with them. When you're homeschooled you're mostly self-taught. One other reason why I wouldn't recommend homeschooling is because you're not interacting with other students which can cause depression and anxiety. Another reason why homeschooling is not such a great idea is because when he learns how to write and read and play a musical instrument and masters soccer, running, or other sports in general how will this particular student learn how to communicate to the real world if the parent has kind of isolated him from meeting people. One of the other reasons why homeschooling is bad is because the fact that parents may lose patience when they are trying to educate their children. Some parent may be too overbearing or impatient, which may cause the child to react negatively. I think homeschooling is a bad idea is because he wouldn't get the proper education like most students in school. That could possibly affect the student and also that student is not interacting with other students which could lead to depression and anxiety. If the parent loses their patience the child would start to act up on them. For all of these reasons homeschooling is not a good idea.
