Yes I am agree with Emerson statement: if we attempt to do something in our life to make a better life or what we have already otherwise we will never Developed. What kind of attempting we have to do for development? We need to have education for development that we can make our life better. We can start our education from beginning of our life which is called school, college, university, etc. We should learn and keep our education in these places until we reach to our goal and success. Education is the best option for us that we can know everything, make our mistake correct, and we try to receive our diploma as soon as possible by hard studying, and every day learning the new things base on our life. We should look for the way that we can grow our self and do not lose our opportunity in during our life. Education is a process of life can grow your mind to better know about new stuff. This is a chance probably happen for one time, but it doesn't matter whenever you get it. Basically when the students finish these process, they will graduate, and then they will gain their diploma from any of those places after that, they will become an educated person with a high careers in their society. Although, some people don't like studying, or maybe they don't want it, they are preferring work careers instead of education.
