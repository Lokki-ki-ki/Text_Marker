Some people believe distance learning is a good option for students, because they can be at home, and they can take the classes they need and with this option they are able to do others activities, they need to do every day. For example, students who don't have the enough of money, and they need to work. This show that many students get benefits from this option that school give to students, because students can work by the day and take the class by the night.in another example we have students that for any reason can not attend to school. They could stay at home and also get the credits they need to graduate from school. This option is also good for the students who want to graduate early from school. For example, students that only want to be by 3 years at school, they can take the regular classes and also can take some classes as distance learning. This suggests that all schools should have this program, because it is so helpful for students who want to graduate from school, but they can't attend school.online classes also help people who already finish the school, but they want to continue studying, and they can take class online. For example a teacher who have a basic degree to teach, but he wants to get a master degree. He or she can teach by the, and he can take his classes online, when he gets free time.in conclusion this option is very helpful for students, and it is an option with all the schools should have.
