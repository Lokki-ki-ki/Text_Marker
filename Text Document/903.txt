Peple can change they first impression this location I am disagree with this statement because sometimes people act different like when I first meet my girlfriend Was thinking that she was a happy person but with the time I see that she was not that happy my impression changes of that situation. The majority of the people act different when they meet some a person that they're going to meet for example, when you're going to see a job you need to act happy and smile to they can accept you but in reality you are sad so with the time they changes that first impression. So a lot of people when they meet a person they have a different impression, so the other person can think that she or he is happy or have a good first impression or sometimes you act normal but we the tome you change and your impression too. Another reason is when you when tat new school at the first time you act that you are cool, and you say things that they like to they can accept you so with the time they're going to know that was a different impression. In my opinion I think that your first impression can change, because in the first Impression it is not your self so when you go to work they can know who are you and they going to accept you like that so when you're going to meet a person be your self because that going to be your impression.
