Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote," To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.'' Even though some people disagree, I agree with Emerson's statement. The world that we live in has always been cruel, and it will always be. Growing up in life you will see a lot of people trying to bring you down, do the wrong things and take the wrong path, it is your job to make the right decisions. For example, friends will invite you to do wrong things such as doing drugs, something you are not supposed to do, it will only get you addicted, poor, homeless or all of these combined. They will ask you if you want to try it, and they will tell you that it is just for fun and that you will like it, don't listen. You will see people trying to make you do other bad things, even worse than doing drugs, such as stealing from other people, beating somebody up or even killing someone. Be yourself and don't listen to those type of people. Stealing, beating or killing is illegal acts, and it will only get you in jail or even maybe killed. Another reason why Agree with Emerson's statement is because you should stay away from people that doesn't care about their acts, life or future. Don't try doing crazy things just to fit in because someone told you to do it, be yourself, be happy, and people will like you the way you are, they will accept you the way you are, even with all your problems. Forget about what the world wants you to be and focus on yourself, so you can be whatever you want to be. Life is too short for people to tell you how to live your life, you only get to live once, it should be your right to live right. And this is why I believe being yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.
