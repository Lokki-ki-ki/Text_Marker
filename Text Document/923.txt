Small kindness can impact others. Because you can make their day go much better if they're not felling "Okay" we can get a smile out of their face or saying "everything is going to be okay" saying something nice can impact something that motivates them or making their day go better saying positives things not negative stuff that's going to make their day go even worse and making them feel like they are nothing in this world everybody comes to this word for a purpose they not just here to do nothing but if we make that person feel like he is nobody in this world he might say "there is no point of me being here" And that person might finish with his life because they're treating him like he is nobody. There are two types of people in this world one of them are the nice people and the other ones are just mean and bad be chosen what type of people do we want to be nobody can force us to be someone we don't want to be we do it are self this word will be full of hate if kind people didn't exist. People might go and say something negative to the other Pearson and if you're hurting that p[person feelings you're just hurting yourself too, or you might not even care about yourself you just care about what people might say to you or think about you and you're just making other people feel bad. Because if they treat you like trash your not just going to treat others like that, or you can just not talk to other people, or they might try to help you out you choose you get help, or you can stay the way you are and not get help but we all gotta treat people with kindness no matter who they are just treat people like you want to be treated it or get help. Good people still exist start treat everybody with respect and kindness. Get a smile out of people face they want to be happy, but they just need to learn how to smile and be happy with others being kind and treat them with respect that's what is all about helping a friend out not giving a friend your back when they really need you staying with them in the good or bad moments."everything is going to be okay" giving people advice of what's good and bad and being kind to one another.
