Some people say that to converse resources, some businesses have adopted a four-day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours. Our school is deciding if they should do a four-day school week, with nine hours consisting each day. Others rather to have a normal school week. I agree with having the normal school week because, The majorly of the high school students have part times jobs they work after school and having a nine hours school day would not leave enough time for students to work in a part-time job, There are some girls at high school that have babies, and they are paying babysits, with a nine hours school days moms would spend less time with their babies, and they would have to pay more hours to babysits, With a nine hours school day the amount of time to study, do homework or prepare for projects would be less than a normal school day of seven hours that can affects students grade. Other people say schools should follow this model because, A nine-hour school day means more time for each class and having more time in all classes it's helpful for homework or late work, They can take advantage of having Friday off students can have a job only on Fridays.
