It has been said that first impression are impossible to change. Based on my experience, I totally disagree with this statement. Here is my reasons why I disagree first impression are impossible to change. First, When you get to know a person, you always have a first impression on them. It could be negative or positive; however, it could change over time. For example, when I met my best friend for the first time, I had a bad impression on him. I thought he was serious and boring, but it turns out he was actually fun to be around with and joyful. Secondly, It's not the same knowing the person for the first time than knowing the person for a long period of time. For example, people don't have the confidence of showing their selves when they meet the person for the first time. Although they are cases that first impression stays the same; however, it could change depend on how the person treats them. In conclusion, first impression could always change based on how you act. You need to get to know the person more to be able to change their first impression. And here are my reason on why I disagree first impression are impossible to change.
