Many people in the history of the world were important because they become who they want to be, and now society try to persuade people from who they are and change to what they want, to be your self in a world that is constantly trading to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment, also you decide who you want to BEI agree with this because sometimes parents try to change their children, also school making decision for their students, religion first point parents trying to change their children, in some cases parents try to persuade their children from what they want to do or from what they want to be on the future, if some one of their children want to play soccer and if their parents do not know everything about soccer they search anything they just say no, and they make their children to try something different or if the child do not want to go the place that they are going most of the parents do not listen what their sons want or like and also sometimes parents make their children to be what they do not what to be in some cases parents tell they children that they need to play an instrument like the guitar, but maybe that child wants to play the drums. Some famous people are unhappy because their parents make them to become famous, but maybe that child does not want to do that. Second point sometimes school makes decision for students too sometimes students do not want to take some classes and school choose for them, in some parts students do not like to wear uniforms, and they make them to wear it, in case that you came from other country, and you do not speak the same language you need to be able to learn because if you did not do it you are not able to be in the school and if you do not understand what are they talking about is hard, but you need to be like them because you do not have people who speak the same language as you do, so you have to be part of something even if you do not like it third point religion is there to try to change your mind they are many religions in the world, but all depends on if you want to choose one of those religions but sometimes people try to make you part of that religion and sometimes you change completely of whom you was if that work for you is perfect but if not you are going to be completely different person, you need to dress different at you usual do, and also they tell you what is wrong and what is not wrong even if you did not do anything wrong they think that, and they always want you to belief things that maybe are not true but why we need to follow that and why we need to believe that, so if you want to do something do that thing because you want it not because someone tells you. In my opinion I agree with what Albert Emerson wrote because to be our self in this world that is constantly trading to make us something else is the greatest accomplishment, is hard to be our selves because people are always trading to tell us about what we are going to do because for the society what they do is good, but maybe you have a different idea but most of the time you need to do what they tell you to do the best accomplishment is being your self and being what you want to be and if you want to do something just do it and do not listen about what other people say or what they think because people are never happy with the things that you do.
