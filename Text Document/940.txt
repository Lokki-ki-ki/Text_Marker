There are some schools that let the students use their cell phones to do classwork or any other educational purposes, and that follows some advantages and disadvantages. Some advantages are, you will be able to finish your work in class and not having work left to do for homework. This was very helpful for me, because I had the chance to do my classwork or my homework using my cell phone or the other devices to finish as much as I can of work before I get home. Some disadvantages will be, after the students finish using their cell phones to do the classwork, they will keep using it for things other than the classwork, like checking social media, or texting, or watching YouTube, that what I saw in my classroom, I saw students were watching YouTube videos or texting, or some other things that they shouldn't be doing it and wasting their time on it. People sometimes don't realize or think about how are they wasting their time by using the cell phone. Teachers should be strict about having and using a cell phone in classroom. Students get in trouble because of the cell phone, they don't think before they use the phone, they do what they want without thinking about the risk that they might get into. Use your cell phone, but you got to use it Wesley, so you won't get in trouble and wasting time.
