Well I want to start saying that the first impressions about people can change but if the impressions change is because something happen. I'm saying it because of some of my experiences with other people that I met and change my impressions about them. Sometimes people don't change, instead of saying that people change your impressions about them maybe you need to know your self first and see what is happening also you need to know why that person change your impressions because maybe something sad or bad is happening on their life, and you don't know it. So let me tell you an experience that happen to me a few months ago, so I met this girl, and she was very nice with me and I start thinking that she was that nice with everyone and no I was wrong she only was that nice with me, so I decide to date her, so I tell her if she want to go to see a movie next weekend, and she tells me, yes! And I say great so like 3 days before going to see the movie she starts acting weird and I ask her if she was OK? And she tells me yes, so the next day I start talking with her, and she tell me what was happening, and she tells me that her mother was sick, and she was sad, so she tells me everything that was happening, and I understand why she was acting weird. In conclusion my impressions about her, it was starting to change, but I decide to talk with her to see what was happening, before that I start saying that she change and my impressions about her change. Is bad to change the impressions about a person without knowing what is happening in their life, because you don't know if that person is waiting for you to ask them what is happening. So I think you should ask that person what is happening, and then you decide what are you going to do. These are some of the many reasons why I disagree with the statement.
