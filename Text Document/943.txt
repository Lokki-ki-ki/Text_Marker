As I'm part of Generic_City community, the majority of students have been changing the opinions about the transformation of our cafeteria foods that will occur. Recently the cafeteria have decided to become a new healthier school lunch menu by eliminating some students' favorite cafeteria foods and providing a completely new meats. This change is a good idea, I am certain this action was taken to awareness as students to eat healthier also to build an efficient body. Eating healthier will make people aware of the fact that they must change their meats and life routine, Also it encourages them to practice sports as the athletes students and at some point they will prefer so much to take care of their health by dieting, being familiar with the vegetables, fruits, and milk. And going to the gym constantly on purpose to build a beautiful body. In addition, Eating unhealthier causes the disperses and the isolation when we became adults. Furthermore, this strategic will reduce the percentage of getting cancers and dangerous diseases in the future due to lack of knowledge of nutrition. Being fat makes our life more difficult imperfection, and tiny. It is so necessary to be flexible and active in our life. The spastics say that many people die young cause of heart attack that occurred from the unhealthy food such as the poison ingredients. My primary reason that I support this action is the importance of eating healthy. It increases our intelligence the students will notice their progress in school by paying more attention in the classroom. Also, it benefices our beauty of body by making the person looks much better and attractive. And it makes us feel so much powerful in our life. In conclusion, Many students are affirmative with this action, whereas there are many students criticize it too.I am going to support highly this idea by making them aware of its importance.
