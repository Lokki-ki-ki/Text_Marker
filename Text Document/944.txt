In order for students to have a good experience at the school, we would like to partner up with your company, so students can just have that. Because many schools doesn't allow that offer to students but here at Generic_School we would like to take learning differently and fun. So we would like to have in total of one-thousands of Hershey chocolate milk because it seems that students like it so much to the point where students even made a paper bringing back chocolate milk. So we would like to partner up and get Hershey milk for students here. So the students can be happy and think that this school is a wonderful place for others and Hershey milk seems to make all the students happy and if you have any other products we would like to try them!. In order to see what's the healthiest and tastiest for our students, and we would like them in a small container in order to be clean and organized and good for nature and make the milk low fat as well for those other students, so they can have a try them self.- the manager
