I agree with the principal because some school work may include working together as a team and if they do an activity like sports, they can learn now things like find different ways to score or if they are losing they find ways to come back. And I think it's a good idea for students to participate in an extracurricular activity because they can spend time with friends, or you can join a club that can help you with your homework and if you want to play a sport, you can sign up for an activity that doesn't need to tryout for that sport And if you want to get some college credits then you can sign up for an activity that can help you get some college credit a good way to get some,there are multiple ways to get some college credits like a good one is learning a language that is a good way to some college credit. You have nothing to do after school you can join an activity that can keep you busy. And this is why I agree with the principal because it can help us in the further on in life.
