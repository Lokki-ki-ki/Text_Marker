Should people be able to make their own decisions or should people find some help? As we know, sometimes we just don't take bad decisions at work, we also take bad decisions in our personal life, and it is not just because you felt it was right. Every day for some reason your feelings are involved so that makes that your ideology of your decisions change, and let's talk about meet someone or get a new job opportunity, every little detail change the way that you think, feel, talk, and yes the way you make decisions and that is okay and normal. Make our own decisions is one of the things that characterize us as a human, our necessity to express what we feel, what we wish, is the thing that have show us what are we capable of make, do, learn, built, invent, all the things that you can imagine in here are because humanity express their thoughts and make their own decisions.Otherwise, you are autonomous, and you do not need that someone tells you what to do all the time, but do not take my point wrong, I am not saying you can do whatever you want because sometimes you would need some help and I can give you some examples where and how sometimes you would need help and your decisions and choices can not be just yours. It can be in a court, your job, school or when you are not an adult, as you can see that there are some places, situations and times you can not decide for you own. I believe we can make our owns decisions because I know if we do everything according to the rules that are around us, we can really choose our life and take responsibilities for that. In fact, you are free to take your own decisions and be responsible for them(when you choose wrong) because it does not matter if you take a wrong decision, it matters that if you have the opportunity to try and figure what you want, it is okay to be wrong sometimes and also is wonderful to be right, the important thing is that you can choose because deserve to have the right to build your life, be wrong, learn and be free.
