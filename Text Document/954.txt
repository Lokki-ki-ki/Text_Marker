Philosopher Albert Schweitzer once said, "Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing." meaning setting a good example by your own behavior to influence other people. Some say setting a good example is the best way for one to influence others, on the other hand, there are better ways to influence others. The best ways to influence other is to show motivation and to be positive in what is being accomplished. Motivation is a major aspect to those trying to reach or accomplish a certain goal. For example, a person is trying to lose weight and be in better shape to do or a sport in school, but that person isn't feeling motivated to do anything, with even a little motivation by saying "it's going to be tough at the start, but once you feel like giving up ask yourself why you started" can get that person moving and determined to reach the goal that's being aimed for. Not only is Motivation a huge impact in influencing other, Being positive is a major key to get others moving. Being positive can affect others in a way to get them more influenced. For example, a person is trying to write a song but just can't seem to figure out what or how to write it, stress and anger is taking over but showing the positive can allow that person to relax and have a clear mind on knowing what to write about. Being positive can easily affect those that are around and by saying, thinking, and listening to positive things is can influence so many others. There are millions of other ways to influence people, and it most certainly is the best way to do so. Motivation and being positive can indeed help those who need the influence, even when they can't reach their goal or can't be able to write a certain song, these following reasons have showed how it can help and many more can be done to influence others.
