Dear sir:It is wonderful how much may be done if we're always doing.'' But I think we always need I break during our activity and work, when we work a lot we can't make all dreams true, but remember that we something have a family and this can't cause family problem, if you are not extent time with them. During work time all the employee has to have break. Because the help everybody, to have a good mental work in their job. No break during work time, can't cause bad discuss, bad service bad communication with all consumers, family problems. Break can't help the employee to be good at work, and the way we can't have a good communication with everybody and also with all customers. And also if you have family, you can't prevent problems with them too. Sometimes some people work a lot, but they forget that they have a family in home waiting for them, that's why a lot of people diverse, because they don't have a good communication.
