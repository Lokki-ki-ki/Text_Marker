It has been said that the first impressions are impossible to change. First impressions are not impossible to change because you don't know what someone is going through in their day. When I started working, one of the guys wasn't nice to anyone. What I didn't know was he was having a bad day. After a while he started to feel better and being nice to others, and I realize he was a good person. Another example is when I transfer from Generic_School to Generic_School i fourth it was going to be horrible. I have to start from zero like meeting new teachers and new people and knowing the school. After a week the teacher and people I met were nice and good people. I didn't like idea of transferring of schools and leaving the people I know from Generic_School. For some other people the first impression is impossible to change. Like when companies are looking for people to hire, but they want people that are self condiment,hardworking, resposible. If a person don't show any good impression in their interview most likely is not going to get hired. However, people can change impressions over time. Like in the If a person didn't show a great impression in the job interview giving them a change it might change their first impression. I think it is possible to change first impression.
