In the future what would you like to accomplish in school. Well I would like to know how to play the clarinet and learn how to play it for many reasons. First, the good thing about the clarinets is that I like when someone plays the clarinet, and it sounds smooth it gives me the chills. Also, when they hit a high note on it is gives me chills too. When playing high notes on it is looks easy. Although when playing the clarinet sometimes when I go to a concert there is always at least one person that squeaks when playing it. I tried to play on it once and It's hard to play when I try to play it fast. But the worst part when playing the clarinet is chipping the reed, once when you chip it you won't be able to play as good on it. The only reason I want to learn how to play the clarinet is because I like the way it sounds, it sounds to calming and soothing. In order for me to accomplish to play calming and soothing is to practice at least 1 hour every day. Also, my last reason to play the clarinet is because i kind of think that it looks easy to play, but I guess that it is a hard instrument to play. These are my reason on why I would want to accomplish and play on the clarinet.
