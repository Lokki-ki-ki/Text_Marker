In my opinion disagree. Because some people said that is hard, take a lot of time. For example, you have to know how works all the processing, and people do not understand, so some time is very confused. So in my opinion that first impressions, are very wrong because no everyone wants to be like different. Secondly is very impossible to change because people do not have time to take care about that stuff. Also, because they work they have boobies, shores, take care of their family so is very difficult to be part of that. But also people said that first impression is bad because is impossible to make right. In addition, some people said that take a while to get used it because you need to be sure, to your goal come true. Also, you have to work very hard, and if you do not have enough, time you not are able to get it so that mean, you have to work hard. Example like people said that impressions, are almost impossible to change well, for some reason it should be easy or hard we don't know. In conclusion, I disagree because impressions, is not easy to take care too, many work in little of period of time, so it will take me forever to do it correct. But also people, said that is very hard and is total true, so impressions are very hard to take care.
