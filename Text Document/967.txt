I disagree with Thomas Jefferson because you need to be inactive sometimes to lay back and relax. If you're always up AMD doing something then you won't really have much rest. You can be active and get stuff done but also kick back sometimes and recharge your energy.I'm not saying that you shouldn't do you're work but don't forget to do that work you need to get energy. Another reason is if you're sick and can't move around so you don't have to do anything then as well. There are many excuses for you not to do something. You should do stuff tho like the important things you need done. For instance go to a doctor's appointment or get groceries. Just because you don't have to do something all the time doesn't mean you shouldn't move from being an idle. You should never be an idle tho. You should always get up and get an exercise or cardio because laying down and not doing anything can also cause sickness in your body that you don't want. That's what I think of this prompt and those are the reasons I give.
