A diploma is a trophy we all want to have and be proud of, but notionally not all of us deserve it. We are graduating only once in our life, and to be able to graduate we must have a strong character that has confident, vision, and goals in life. The universe, destiny or even life won't share with us the opportunities that provides just for free, we have to move forward and challenge our own person to dedicate every moment to that goal we want to reach. A graduation it's not a competition neither a race where only us will win because behind and in front of us there are a million of other more people looking for what we are sacrificing for. There are benefits that qualify to graduate before the traditional year and also graduating at the right time. In three years you could accomplish what you wanted to do and go out and have more time to plan your life and what you want to do, however, completing the four years of high school will allow you to enjoy and experience more opportunities to do extra activities and spend that little time that you will never have. I agree in both options, I think we all choose the best for us, graduating before doesn't mean you are smarted neither that if you graduate in four years you are incapable.in conclusion, we are not competing we are reaching the goal we want to be proud of and deserve, we need self-confident and to have an open mind to the reality we face day by day, we only have one opportunity in life, we decide how to spend it or how to waste it, we choose our who I really am and going to be, because all we do now it's what we are going to see in our future, if we don't prepare don't think your having a diploma to your position, but if you develop your plans and prepare the triumph will be mayor.
