My enjoyable educational activity I chose was soccer because it is a sport you do a lot of running. Soccer can be played all over the world. Long time ago people used to say that all sports were for men only but today men and women play sports thanks to the changing of the laws. A day before a soccer game, players have to train so hard in order to win. They have to learn new tricks, and they have to run a lot. All soccer players must have enough energy to run because it can lead to mistakes and can cause the team to lose. Soccer players need to be concentrating on the ball at all times, and they have to make sure where they kick because if they kick too hard, they can hit someone in the stadium. During a game, there has been so many injuries due to running so fast and tripping players, and then it causes a huge argument over the injured player. At all times if people want to be a soccer player, they have to play clean. There are kids that want to grow up to be the best soccer player and for that they have to start early and join a team in a school or in other places that let kids play. Sometimes kids play at their house with siblings or other people in their family and that can be a good practice for a game in your team. Playing soccer is a great sport, and it helps people lose weight because of the amount of running. Some people play soccer for money because they got things to pay, others just play for fun. Some people say that soccer is just for Hispanics, but it isn't true because almost everyone plays soccer no matter the race. In soccer, it is best for your team to have a great coach and that he/she is good at teaching because sometimes it's the coach's fault that they lose and he/she starts blaming everyone. Everyone has to try their best in any sport no matter what but its most important to concentrate on the sport and not be thinking about anything else but the sport because you can lose track and make your team lose, and your team can be mad at you.
