Having a problem can lead to success if you try your best. "A problem is a chance for you to do your best"- Duke Ellington. Everyone has problems in their lives even if it's a small or big issue, everyone wants easy fix problems but sometimes having them can give people chances to do their best. Being in a big issue where people don't know what do to, they will have to take chances and having to think to get out of the situation. For example if someone forgets their homework at school some choices are to print the homework at home or at a library. Not knowing what to do on a homework is never good but trying your best, even if it's wrong. Duke Ellington is right because taking chances to do your best is great, and you never know if something you made or done could be used in the future. Every job have situations for example builders may not have the materials that are needed, or teachers may not be able to read the handwriting. People who do parlor have to do their best to not fall off a building and if they are in a situation where they can jump to a different building or thing they might have to take chances and do their best to get to the other side. Anything can be a problem but if you try your best that is all that matters.
