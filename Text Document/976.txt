Do you believe that in order to success is going through failure contently? People think that going through failure can help you be successful though out time. Some example could be emotions, not giving up, and a quote "Third time is the charm." These are some of the things that people do in order to succeed though failure. First, when people can not get something right the first time they can get emotional such as upset, mad, and frustrated and many more. An example of this could be when you are working on a math problem, and you did not get the right answer the first time people can get upset. That is why emotions can be a part of failing to get successful. Moreover, when people can not get something done they tend to just give up and do nothing. People should never give up because not everyone gets it the fist time. One example can be when you are trying to find information about an animal, and you can not find anything on it, so you just give up and not do the research information, and now you are going to get a zero for it which is not good. This is why you should never give up even if it is hard for although, most people have heard this saying "third times the charm." This saying has a meaning to it because it is telling you that you have to keep on trying in order to get it right. Sometimes when you keep on trying it can turn out better than the other times that you tried. One example can be when are drawing something, and you do not like it you can try again and do it better than the first time. Keep on trying in till you like it or in till you get it right. This is why this saying is very important to understand. In conclusion, in order to succeed through failure can always be a good thing, and it can help you to become better but most importantly to feel good about yourself and the success that you made.
