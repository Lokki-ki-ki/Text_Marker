Who doesn't like getting an extra day off? Who doesn't love staying home on Mondays? I think schools should follow these businesses model by extending the school day two hours and adopt a four-day school week. Although the students might hate the hour extensions, they would love to have a four-day school week. However, there are a lot of benefits and disadvantages in this model. Lots of students would agree to having a four-day school week. There are a lot of benefits for students if they only have to come for school for four days. Students would have extra time to finish their homework, they would also get some more time to spend with their family, and would be able to travel for an extra day. Students could get a lot of things done with that extra day they get off if they only have a four-day school week. Even though the model comes with lots of benefits there are also lots of disadvantage with it as well. Students might not like having to stay in school for an extra two hours. This is a huge disadvantage because some students have after school jobs they might not be able to attend if school hours got extended. Other students might have to take care of their families after school. Extending school hours would be a disadvantage to everyone because it will most likely mess up schedules. If school hours got extended students might not be able to find jobs that work with their schedules. The school should think about having a four-day school week but shouldn't extend the school day two hours. The model has its ups and downs, advantages and disadvantages but It's still a good model. Students would love to only be in school for four days. They would probably hate having to stay for extra two hours, so the school shouldn't do that. The four-day school week gives a lot of benefit to the students. All school should consider only having a four-day school week.
