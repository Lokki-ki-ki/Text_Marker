Every day all the people in the world make a lot of decisions and each one have different way to decided. Sometimes you have to ask for help, because there is a lot of people with experienced for example, parents, teachers and experts. I think decisions can affect your future and also can affect other people. Adults, specially old people have a lot of advices for you to be a better person.First, decisions are the key of the one person and can affect the future for the rest of the life. For example, education is one of the most important things in the life, and that's why your parents always keep saying go to school, and finish the high school that advice is given to you because they want to see a better future for you, and you have to listen because is the experienced that is talk is not your parents. Second, adults have a lot of experience specially old people (grandmother and grandparent). For example, every time when your parents talk for your future, they know about the life because all they have experienced and maybe when they were young, make a bad decisions and that's why the given to you a lot of advices because they worried about you. Finally, most of the time specially (young girls and boys) when they decided something always is wrong because they only care they self, but that decisions can affect other people. For example I from Generic_City and in my country all the time you see young people make the decision to drop out of school and get to the gangs. As a result, they get to the jail, or they died and the only people who cry is your family because they want all the best for you. In conclusion make decisions is not easy for each one because some are easily and some are hard, but I think you shoot ask all the time first for help with your parents and with experts because they have a lot experienced.
