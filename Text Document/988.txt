Hello my name is Generic_Name. I'm grateful to be writing this letter to you, I hope I am fortunate to get picked to visit and learn from you and your staff. Cybersecurity is a career I would like to pursue as I get older, it would be a dream come true to come work with you and your staff. Being able to hack for a living would be amazing.Cybersecurity interest me ever since I got introduced into hacking. I did little hacks like into my brothers computer or jail braking my phone, Little things like that. I would like to one day work for the FBI, and help protect important information from other hackers. If I were to get selected to come visit and learn, it would one day would help me in the future. I hope to make it big one day and hope to work along you. It would be great to get a feel of what it would feel like to work in that environment. I wonder what it feels like is the; place quiet, what equipment do they use, how long have they been working as a hacker. I've never visited an FBI agency, I hope I do though to witness all of you guys in action and what you do on a daily basis. This program would because it would give me an idea of the work environment so when I get older I know what I'm getting into. Also, it would get even more motivated to for harder every day to make it big and work with the FBI. I would consider my self a good a focus person and most importantly I am very patient. I'm a very responsible person I'm Evan a very hard work I always try my best Evan way over on what I do. Especially when it comes to computer work, I have very supportive parents but in the future I would like to make good money. Nothing would make me happier then to be a hacker for the FBI for my care, it would be a dream come true. That is why I think I should be considered to be selected to learn from you and your fellow staff.
