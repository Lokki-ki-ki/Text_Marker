In this world everyone has a talent or skill. Some people use their talent for good things, and some for bad things. My talent is honey, and I use this talent for good things like, I tell the truth all the time, never betray someone, and I am always fair. To begin, my first reason about how I use this talent for good things is that I tell the truth all the time. Because of that, everyone trusts me, and tell me their secrets. Telling the truth all the time also help people recognize me as a good person, and help me make lots of friends. Telling the truth all the time would not only help people recognize me as a good person, but it will also make everyone trust me. To continue, my second reason is that I never betray someone. Never betraying someone will make people think that I am a good person, and people that didn't like me will start liking me. Never betraying someone is also a good thing because it will make you loyal, and faithful. People that you never betrayed will like you and become your friend.Furthermore, my last reason about how I use this talent for good things is that I am always fair. I treat everyone the same way I want to be treated, and that will make people treat me the same way they want to be treated. I also divide things evenly, so everyone have the same amount. If you want people to treat you fairer than, you have to treat them fair. In conclusion, my talent is honesty and I use it for good things like, telling the truth, never betraying, and being fair. I treat people the way I want to be treated and believe it or not they treat me the same way, so whatever talent you have used it for good things instead of bad things.
