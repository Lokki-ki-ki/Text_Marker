I disagree I feel like everyone should have entitled of being whoever they want to be, or however they want to be. No one should be said or be told how to be something that they're not or don't want to be. Personally always try to be myself, stay positive and with head up even when people in this world are constantly Trying to bring me down, making me feel bad, not believing in me, or expecting me to change.Sometimes I get constantly brought down, when it comes to my emotion. My family is sometime judgmental. I get treated differently when it comes to my sister and I. My sister is better when it comes to Education, Maturity, or being responsible in their eyes. I try my best as a person to prove them wrong. I constantly feel bad because my parents tell me something that they might think it's not hurtful, but it's more so a "contrastive unitization". It's never enough for them, what I do.I'm the most productive in my house do everything before it's even asked. Making sure the house look neat and organize. Keeping my head up, and always prove them I'm better. It's hard to live with people that always take you for granted and treats your differently, because you were born with a learning disability. Not being taking serious, getting treated as a little girl, Always being the one who is "the problem". Everyone is not perfect, and we all try to better ourselves, and move on. Making the best of it no matter if it is a matter of how much you know, you're worth it, and you know much more you can give and proof. That you can accomplish what you put yourself and mind to. Never giving up always looking high. No matter how much people try to bring you down, you should always keep your head up. Keep fighting and prove everyone wrong. People might not always have something good to say or nice. Never let no type of negativity get to your head, Stay positive at all cause always possible. The sky is the limit and no one can tell you otherwise.
