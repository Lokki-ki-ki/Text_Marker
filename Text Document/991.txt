I disagree with this statement, because some people can change, how people look at them and given a good impression again, for example if the person died do well the first time, he would do better the second time, it is like given a second opportunity, second example is that the person who you are given the opportunity to change, is not point nothing to change it, is better to not give them a second change. For me the first impression is not too much important, because that first impression can change at any time, and the one how you dire t give him a second change, and be better they the first one my experience was one day I have done a poster, and my was ugly when the teacher say that the have to do other poster in a group and nobody what to join my group, and i finished by myself Jen the teacher caliph the poster, may was the best one in the class.
