I'm not agree to the schools districts programs for the students to finish their diploma in three years because it is not enough time in three years then than four years and the students going to study to hard. In the summer and in the evenings the students brain is going to get tire they can not go ta have break they can not go to have the important courses of elective class can be force for the students. However if they finish in three years the advantage is finish faster but than can not help to the students also they're going to do hard work to study in the summer and evening. I think that finish high school in three years is not a good idea because is better to have the time necessary four years is important is more time.second is if the students finish the school in three years the students they have to having must work hard. In the summer and in the evening i think that the students can be got very tire it is good to have the time and is got more focus before got the university.it is better to study more and thing what route do you want to go and take the necessary time. For the student is help more because four years is more time then. Thant three years, and they can not be frosted for then, and they can have more free time to do the personals things.it is better before go to the university and work force because is more time to prepare the students having to focus more on learned more things is good to now more before take the time it is important for the students that four years in the school is going to help for the students in the future for what carers they're going to be doing.
