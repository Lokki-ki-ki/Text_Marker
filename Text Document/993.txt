Yes, is a good idea because if high school selected to guide them toward a specific career, because we can see how difficult be, or if be easy to go the college, however, is good idea, because you can see if you are sure of want the specific career, or you want change for other career, because some time the career you want is be difficult, and you can't do it. So we can have ideas how the college be, so if the high school put the option be great, because when you finished the high school you really have an idea what you want to pick for the college or what career you want to take. Some time was make difficult to pick the class or the career because didn`t have ideas, so with this option is being great because we have ideas how take a college class. When you are not sure what you want to pick for your career, this is a good option, because be help you to know how college is. Is good idea, because the students be really have an idea how the college is, and when the students be had to go to the college be going with some ideas, and the students really know how the college or the class is, because they were ideas from the high school. I agreement with this option because is being helper for all the students, this is being helper for when we have to go the college or university, and you really know what talk about or what is going on. This option is being great, because at a young age, they know something about the college, and when they be had to go the college or university they remind what land in the high school, so this be helper to all students because is being good think. When the student going to the college they're going with ideas or think, so that is easier because they have a fomenting mind and that is being great.
