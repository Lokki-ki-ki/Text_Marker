I am not agreed with this, because the school hours star at 7 am and end to 2:10 pm, in that time we can work after school, and do other important things that we have in the day, but if the school adopted this rule, the days for the students are gone, because if the school take that rule, the students are going home from the school at 4 pm, and they are arrived home at 5 pm, so they don't go to have time for do others things, like work or do the homework, because they just go home to sleep and do some things that the students have to do in home for help in the house. But for the work weeks are better because they are going to have more time or one more day for have fun with their family, and they don't have any problems because they just have to stay two more hours and they're going to have one more day off and that is better for they, because is like that they are working that day, and they get the same pay and the workers just go to work and then go home. Except for some students are different because they have to go to the school, and they have to get up early, and after school they have to go at work, that is difficult for some students, because they go in to the work after school like at 2:30, and go out like at 12:00 am, and they don't sleep anything the rest of the night, and they come tired to the school, but they still come to the school, and they do the work that they have to do in the school, and the home too, so that is why that going to affect the students. I don't think that this new rule going to benefit the students, that rule just benefit the workers, because they're going to have one more day left, and to more hours of work in the day, but for the students they get up early and go out of the school late, and that is bad because, we don't go to have more time for work, just for study and do homework and sleep, that is all the things that we're going to do, if the school adopted that rule the day for students are going to be gone for them. That is what I think about that prompt.
